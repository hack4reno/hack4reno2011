A DataMapper adapter for the Google App Engine Datastore.

Currently this is pretty basic. There's no support for Parent entities,
transactions, Blobs, or Links, for example. Any query supported by the
Datastore should work. That means the like, regexp, and not operators are not
supported. Or is only supported for fetching several entities by the Key.

== Bugs

- DataMapper likes to lazily load properties. The Datastore always sets and
  returns all properties on an entity. If you have lazily loaded properties
  strange things will happen (like properties potentially disappearing).
