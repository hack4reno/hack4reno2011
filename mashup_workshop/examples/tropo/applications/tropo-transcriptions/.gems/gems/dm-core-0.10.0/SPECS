Reading Specs
=============

  Blah blah blah...

Writing Specs
=============

  Here are some general dos and don'ts

  = DO:

  * Write more specs for error conditions than clean conditions.
  * Write specs with readability in mind. Somebody new to DataMapper should be
    able to read specs to learn how something works.
  * Use existing models that are part of a metaphor.
  * Nest describe blocks (2 or 3 levels deep is probably fine).
  * Limit a describe block to 10 - 15 examples.
  * Group specs by method being tested. (See the 'Ordering Specs' section)
  * Use custom matchers.

  = DON'T:

  * Spec more than one unit of functionality in an example. An example should be
    as short as possible (while still remaining readable).
  * Spec implementation. Refactoring code should not break specs.
  * Declare models in the spec file.

  And a final do: Do go against the guidelines if your best judgement tells you
  to. These are just guidelines and are obviously not fast rules.

Mocks and Stubs
===============

  Do not use mocks or stubs for any specs in DataMapper.
