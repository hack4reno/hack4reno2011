=== Description ===
A simple script for beginners that can be uploaded to Tropo's servers and
then be used as an access number to access a directory of numbers and make
outgoing calls.

It's useful if you have one of those "A-List" plans for your cell phone.
Any calls or texts to your Tropo number get forwarded to your phone.

=== Requirements ===
A free Tropo developer account to start off:
https://www.tropo.com/account/register.jsp

=== Usage ===
Upload tropo_access_num.php to Tropo as a Hosted File.
Assign yourself a US number to call.
Use that number as your access number.
