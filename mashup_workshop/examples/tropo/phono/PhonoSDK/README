The Phono SDK provides an object-oriented JavaScript API for embedding
two-way audio and chat onto any web page. The Phono SDK is a pure
client-side solution and requires zero server-side logic on your part;
all communication is handled transparently by the Voxeo Cloud. In the
near future we will release a downloadable Phono Gateway that allows
Phono to connect to any SIP Voice over IP infrastructure directly
without the Voxeo cloud.
