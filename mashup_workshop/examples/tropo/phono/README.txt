Phono
=====

The Phono SDK provides an object-oriented JavaScript API for embedding
two-way audio and chat onto any web page. The Phono SDK is a pure
client-side solution and requires zero server-side logic on your part;
all communication is handled transparently by the Tropo Cloud. In the
near future we will release a downloadable Phono Gateway that allows
Phono to connect to any SIP Voice over IP infrastructure directly
without the Tropo cloud.

This directory contains the Phono SDK as well as two applications 
created on top of it: a phone for calling your Facebook friends and a
phone that can call any Phono user on Twitter.
