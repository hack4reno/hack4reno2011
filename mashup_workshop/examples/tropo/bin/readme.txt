Tunnlr is a fantastic tool for development. It allows you to create a reverse HTTP proxy to your machine.
You don't have to worry about port forwarding, or anything, just let it run!  We have a few great posting on this
here ( http://blog.tropo.com/tag/tunnlr/blog ) on our blog.

This script just needs to be setup by adding your username, and port number, from your tunnlr preference page.

You can then deploy it to your ~/bin folder, or whatever location is in your path that works best for you.
