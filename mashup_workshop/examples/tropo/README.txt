Tropo Samples
==============

http://tropo.com/

This USB drive contains sample code, sample applications, and code libraries for
Tropo.

If you can create a web site, you can make and receive phone calls, use voice
recognition, interact over SMS, IM, or Twitter. You can even create conference
calls and transcribe calls. There's no need to learn new languages, wrestle with
VoIP software, or learn about telephony. Host your code with us, or use your
existing web server in the language of your choice.

Tropo adds a few simple communications commands to your favorite programming
languages.

		<?php
		answer();
		say('Yes, Tropo is this easy.');
		// Yup, that's it!
		?>

Also included here is Phono - Tropo's jquery plugin that turns any browser into a 
phone and IM client. Phono is open source and we've included both sample applications
and the source code of the core components.

To use these samples, you'll need a Tropo account. Tropo is 100% free for developer 
usage, and you only start to pay when you move your application into production.

ready to help. Just send an email to support@tropo.com.
