"Alternate Public Defender";;"How do I get a lawyer?

";"If you have been charged with a crime and are facing the potential of a jail sentence, you may apply for legal representation if you cannot afford to hire a lawyer. At the time of your first appearance before the Judge, let the Judge know that you would like an attorney to be appointed to represent you. You will have to meet with an employee of Court Services, who will make the determination on whether or not you qualify.

 

If you are a parent and Social Services have removed your children, placing them in the care and custody of  Washoe County, you may apply for the legal representation as well. Again, you must make the request at the Family Court located at One S. Sierra Street, on the second floor, and the application process can begin.

"
"Alternate Public Defender";;"Can you help me with my divorce, or landlord tenant issues, or small claims?

";"No. Only those who are facing jail or prison time or parents who are facing losing permanent custody of their children through government action are entitled to free legal representation.

"
"Alternate Public Defender";;"Who does my lawyer work for?

";"Every attorney employed by the Alternate Public Defender`s office is an employee of Washoe County.

"
"Alternate Public Defender";;"Is my lawyer really a lawyer?

";"Yes. Every attorney in the Alternate Public Defender`s Office has graduated from law school, and taken and passed the Nevada Bar Exam. In order to be employed as an attorney in the APD office, the lawyer must be licensed in the State of Nevada to practice law.

"
"Alternate Public Defender";;"What kind of cases do the APD lawyers handle?

";"The lawyers in the APD`s office practice in several different courts. There are attorneys who defend adults and juveniles charged with every type of crime, from misdemeanor to murder. Some of the lawyers here work in the family court, representing parents whose children have been removed from the home and are in the care and custody of Washoe County. There is also a lawyer who defends those who are participating in drug, diversion, or mental health court.

"
"Alternate Public Defender";;"What is the difference between the Public Defender`s office and the Alternate Public Defender`s Office?

";"The Washoe County Public Defender`s Office initially takes every case where a person has been appointed a lawyer. The cases are then screened by staff members to see if there is a conflict of interest. Conflicts of interest can arise if the Public Defender has represented a victim or witness in a case, or if there is more than one defendant charged with the crime. If the Public Defender`s Office determines that there is a legal reason it cannot represent a person, then that case is sent to the Alternate Public Defender`s Office.

 

If the Alternate Public DefenderÂ’s office also has a conflict of interest, then a private lawyer will handle the case.

"
"Alternate Public Defender";;"Where are you located?

";"The Alternate Public Defender`s Office is located at 350 S. Center Street, on the Sixth Floor, in Reno Nevada. The phone number for the office is (775) 328-3955; the fax number is (775) 328-3998.

"
"Alternate Public Defender";;"How can I find out who my attorney is and when I go to court?

";"Once the Alternate Public Defender`s Office is appointed to represent you, we will send you a letter giving you your court date and the name of your lawyer. If you have not received the letter, please call the APD office at (775) 328-3955, and ask the receptionist for the information.

"
"Alternate Public Defender";;"Can I fire my lawyer?

";"No. You are entitled to an attorney, but you are not entitled to the attorney of you choice. Once an attorney in the Alternate Public Defender`s Office has been appointed to represent you, that person will remain your attorney until the case is concluded. Your only other option is to hire private counsel, if you can afford to do so, or to try to represent yourself, which is never a wise choice.

"Assessor`s Office";"A) Real Property";"Why Did My Values Change?";"The Taxable Value can change because of a boundary change, new construction, a change in use, a mandatory five year reappraisal, factoring in years a reappraisal is not done, or any combination of these factors.

"Assessor`s Office";"B) Tax Cap";"What Is The Partial Abatement?";"<a href=http://www.leg.state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-361.html#NRS361Sec471>NRS 361.471-361.4735</a> provides for a partial abatement of taxes by limiting or \"capping\" the amount a tax bill can increase from year to year.  The increase is limited to 3% for an owner occupied primary residence (single-family home, townhouse, condominium or manufactured home) and certain qualified rental properties.  Tax bills for all other properties (residences that are not owner occupied, land, commercial buildings, business personal property, aircraft, etc.) are limited to a percentage not to exceed 8%.
<ul>
<li>If the property is your primary residence within the State of Nevada, the abatement equals the amount of taxes that exceed last year`s tax bill plus 3%.</li>
<li>If the property contains rental unit(s) and the rent on all units within the property are at or below the fair market rent for the county in which the dwelling is located, as most recently published by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, the abatement equals the amount of taxes which exceed last year`s tax bill plus 3%.</li>

<li>Most other properties (rental units where the rent exceeds the HUD guidelines, commercial, industrial, vacant land, mixed use, etc.), except as noted below, are subject to an abatement at a higher level which is calculated by comparing </li>

<li>           (1) The greater of:
                   (I) The average percentage of change in the assessed valuation of all the taxable property in the county, as determined by the Department, over the fiscal year in which the levy is made and the 9 immediately preceding fiscal years;
                   (II) Twice the percentage of increase in the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers, U.S. City Average (All Items) for the immediately preceding calendar year; or
                   (III) Zero; or
             (2) Eight percent,
whichever is less.</li>

<li>For 2009, the result of the above is 7.7%</li>
</ul>
"
"Assessor`s Office";"B) Tax Cap";"Why did my tax bill increase when my assessed value decreased or did not change?";"Because the current year tax bill is calculated based on the prior year tax bill,  changes in assessed value do not have as much impact on a tax bill (up or down) as they did prior to the law change.

The abatement is the amount of additional taxes that would have been owed if not for the tax cap. For a property with a 3% tax cap, if the 2008 tax bill was $1,000 the 2009 tax bill could be no more than $1,030 even if the calculated taxes (assessed value x tax rate) were $1,050.

In the example above the $20 difference between the actual tax bill of $1,030 and the calculated tax bill of $1,050 is the abatement.

The abatement amount is identified on the tax bill. A decrease in assessed value will not result in a decrease in taxes until the prior year`s tax bill plus your tax cap percentage is greater than your actual calculated taxes. In an increasing market you may receive abatement for each year. In a declining or stagnant market your tax bill may eventually increase until there is no abatement for a tax year.

For most properties, fiscal year 2004/05 is the base year for applying the tax cap and calculating the abatement. Although values may have increased in succeeding years, the new law limits the increase to a tax bill to 3% or 8%.

Any increase in value (except increases due to improvement to or changes in the actual or authorized use of the property) that would cause a property owners tax bill to increase by more than 3% or 8% results in an abatement of the taxes.

For parcels created after fiscal year 2004/05, which are designated as \"new parcels\", the base year would be the year the parcel was created and the abatement and tax cap would apply from that year forward.

"Assessor`s Office";"B) Tax Cap";"What Is Capped Under The Partial Abatement Statutes?";"The statutes provide for a partial abatement of the ad valorem taxes levied on a qualified property.

The tax cap will limit the increase of your tax bill to 3% over the previous year`s tax amount for your primary residence within Nevada or rental properties where the rent charged does not exceed the fair market rent for the county in which the dwelling is located, as most recently published by HUD.  Most other property will receive a higher \"cap\", which, for 2009/2010 is 7.7 % over the previous years tax bill. This higher cap is subject to change yearly.

This applies even if the manufactured home has not been converted to real property.  

If you own the manufactured home but not the land, the manufactured home is eligible for the 3% tax cap. The cap level for the land would be determined based on the space rent charged.

If you own the land but not the manufactured home you would not be eligible for the 3% tax cap unless the space rent is less than the HUD median market rent.

"Building and Safety";;"If I Am Located Within An Architectural Committee, Does The Committee Need To Review The Plans Before I Submit Them For A Permit?

";"Effective January 1, 2007, Washoe County Department of Building & Safety will no longer require/accept architectural committees to stamp plans for committee approval.  All plans submitted for a building permit which have a construction valuation over $500.00 and are located within an area controlled by an â€œactive, sanctionedâ€ architectural committee, shall instead include a letter or written report from the architectural committee as stated by NRS 278.566.

The Washoe County Department of Building & Safety does not enforce applicable CC&R provisions for each subdivision, nor is the Department required under State Statutes.  The intent of the policy change is to establish a method which ensures the architectural committeeâ€™s right of notification under State Statute and to give the committee additional time to take legal action to enforce their requirements.

The Washoe County Department of Building & Safety will continue our policy of encouraging applicants to submit first to their architectural committee for a letter or written report of approval.  However, if the applicant insists on submitting plans, the Department will accept the plans and request, in writing and by certified mail, from the architectural committee a written report.  If the Department does not receive a written report from the architectural committee within 20 calendar days from the date of receipt of the request, the Building Official will proceed as provided by law where there is no functioning committee.  If the architectural committeeâ€™s letter or written report denies approval of the project, the committee will have an additional 30 calendar days to take legal action before an approved permit is issued.  Only a court order filed with the Department can stop the process or issuance of the building permit.

"Community Development";"Citizen Advisory Boards";"What is the purpose of Citizen Advisory Boards (CABs)?";"Citizen Advisory Boards (CABs) assist the Washoe County Commissioners with issues of concern in designated geographic areas.  CABs serve two general purposes:

- They help the Commissioners become aware of the concerns of residents and property owners in their geographical areas, thus enabling the Commission to better address those issues in the best interest of the community and the County; and

- They provide a forum where citizens can be informed about and understand decisions made by the Commission that affect their community."
"Community Development";"Citizen Advisory Boards";"How long have CABs been in existence?";"The first community CAB was the Incline Village CAB (later to be merged with the Crystal Bay CAB) which was established at the request of North Lake Tahoe residents in 1975, even before such boards were formalized by statute. 

The Sun Valley CAB followed in 1978, and the Washoe Valley CAB (first established as a nonprofit corporation by Washoe Valley residents and later divided into two CABs: East Washoe Valley and West Washoe Valley) in 1979. 

The Lemmon Valley and Gerlach/Empire CABs were added in 1980, and the Verdi Township CAB in 1981. In 1982, the North Valleys CAB (which incorporated the Lemmon Valley Board), and the Southwest Truckee Meadows CABs were established, followed by the Northeast Valleys CAB in late 1983 -- which was later divided into the Spanish Springs and Warms Springs CABs. 

Subsequent boards were established for Mt. Rose/Geiger Grade (which was later divided into two separate boards -- Galena-Steamboat and Southeast Truckee Meadows), West Truckee Meadows, East Truckee Canyon, and Cold Springs.  

In 2006, the Central CAB was formed.  The Cold Springs CAB was dissolved in 2008 and the North Valleys CAB was modified to include the Cold Springs CAB area.  In 2009, the Verdi Township CAB and the West Truckee Meadows CAB were dissolved and merged into the Verdi Township/West Truckee Meadows CAB, and the Central CAB was temporarily suspended."
"Community Development";"Citizen Advisory Boards";"What is the legal authority that establishes CABs?";"Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) 244.1945 authorizes the Washoe County Commission to establish advisory boards \"for any purpose relating to the County about which the Board desires study or advice\".  Under this statute, the Commission has created a number of Citizen Advisory Boards (CABs) on countywide issues, as well as creating the system of community CABs.

Washoe County Code, Chapter 5.425 through 5.435, sets forth the specific guidelines for the establishment and operation of CABs. Among other matters, it requires that each CAB be individually established by a resolution of the Washoe County Commission.

These regulations are available from the Washoe County Department of Community Development. The regulations may also be viewed on the County`s website.  To access the Citizen Advisory Board History, Legal Basis and Bylaws, <a href=\"/comdev/boards_commissions/cab/history.htm\" target=_blank>click on this link</a>."
"Community Development";"Citizen Advisory Boards";"How are CABs governed?";"Citizen Advisory Boards (CABs) are governed by a set of bylaws adopted by the Washoe County Commission. The bylaws enable each CAB to follow a standard set of operating procedures while providing enough latitude to allow the CAB to conduct its affairs and meetings in a fashion which encourages public participation.

CAB bylaws are available from the Washoe County Department of Community Development. The bylaws may also be viewed on the County`s website. To access the Citizen Advisory Board Bylaws, <a href=\"/comdev/boards_commissions/cab/history.htm\" target=_blank>click on this link</a>."
"Community Development";"Citizen Advisory Boards";"How are CABs established?";"Citizen Advisory Boards are established by resolution.  The Board of County Commissioners establishes a Citizen Advisory Board (CAB) in areas of the County where residents share similar problems and concerns, and where the community is distinct from other communities.  "
"Community Development";"Citizen Advisory Boards";"How often do CABs meet?";"The volunteer boards generally meet six times a year, though one CAB meets monthly and one CAB meets 4 times a year.  All CABs may also hold special meetings to discuss items or issues which are of immediate or pressing concern to the community."
"Community Development";"Citizen Advisory Boards";"How can I find out about the assigned geographic area of a CAB?";"The geographic area of responsibility for a CAB is established when the Washoe County Commission initially forms a new CAB. Changes to any CAB`s geographical area, if needed, are directed by the Washoe County Commission through a formal resolution.

Maps showing CAB geographic areas of responsibility are available from the Washoe County Department of Community Development.  The maps may also be viewed on the County`s web site by searching for the \"CAB Home Page\" or typing \"www.washoecounty.us/cab\" in the address bar, and then selecting the link for \"CAB Agendas, Minutes, Applications, Maps and Rosters\".  Maps can also be found by clicking on the \"Citizen Advisory Board Maps\" link in the left column.
"
"Community Development";"Citizen Advisory Boards";"What are membership requirements for CABs?";"Citizen Advisory Board (CAB) members must reside within the geographical area of responsibility for their CAB and be a registered voter (if eligible to vote) in Washoe County.  On most CABs, the new member must also be a resident of unincorporated Washoe County.   However, City of Reno residents are eligible for appointment to the Central CAB, North Valleys CAB, Southwest Truckee Meadows CAB, and the Verdi Township/West Truckee Meadows CAB.  City of Sparks residents are eligible for appointment to the Spanish Springs CAB as regular members or as alternates.  The voter registration requirement can be waived on a case-by-case basis by the Washoe County Commission.  New members are required to attend new member orientation within six months of appointment.  "
"Community Development";"Citizen Advisory Boards";"What is the term of office for CAB members?";"Citizen Advisory Board (CAB) members are selected with the intent to provide representation from a broad cross-section of the CAB`s geographical area. The Washoe County Commission strives to ensure that all major viewpoints are examined, and that any faction or special interest group does not dominate a CAB.

Members are appointed by the Commissioners for staggered two-year terms beginning July 1 until June 30 two years hence.  Unexpired vacancies are filled from the date of appointment until expiration of the unfilled term. 

It is the general policy of the Commissioners that Citizen Advisory Board members be appointed for one two-year term to ensure the fullest participation by a broad range of citizens in a neighborhood. However, considerations of continuity may allow for reappointment of a member to a second or third (in special cases) consecutive term. If there are no other qualified applicants, a CAB member may serve a fourth consecutive term at the discretion of the Commission.  A member may not serve more than four consecutive terms on a CAB. "
"Community Development";"Citizen Advisory Boards";"How are appointments made?";"Appointments are made from a list of applicants who have submitted applications within the past year. Generally, an advertisement for applicants is placed in the local newspapers at lease once a year, usually in February or March when the CAB Annual Recruitment effort begins. However, applications may be submitted anytime. 

Applications are available from the Washoe County Department of Community Development. Applications for each specific Citizen Advisory Board are also available on the Countyâ€™s web site by typing \"www.washoecounty.us/cab\" in the address bar to access the CAB Home Page, then selecting the link for \"CAB Agendas, Minutes, Applications, Maps and Rosters\", and then selecting the applicable CAB. Applications for all of the CABs can be found by clicking on the \"CAB Applications\" link in the left column of the CAB Home Page.  To access information about the Citizen Advisory Board membership application packets, <a href=\"/comdev/boards_commissions/cab/membership_packet.htm\" target=_blank>click on this link</a>. 

When a vacancy occurs on a CAB, current applications are submitted to the County Commissioner within whose district the CAB resides. The Commissioner reviews the applications and may interview the applicants. CAB members may make recommendations to the Commissioners concerning appointments.  The Commissioner makes a recommendation on an appointment to the Washoe County Commission, but the Commission makes the final appointment.
"
"Community Development";"Citizen Advisory Boards";"Can a CAB member be removed from the Citizen Advisory Board?";"Yes. There are several reasons why a CAB member might be removed from the board:

- New members are required to attend new member orientation training within six months of appointment.  Failure to comply with this requirement may result in automatic removal.

- Three consecutive unexcused absences from CAB meetings will result in automatic removal from the CAB.

- If the conduct of a CAB member is deemed inappropriate, the Commissioner responsible for the CAB will speak to the individual and, if warranted, take steps to remove the individual from the CAB."

"Community Development";"Development Review and Permitting";"What is a Significant Hydrologic Resource (SHR) and why are there codes to protect streams and creeks?";"A Significant Hydrologic Resource is a creek or stream shown on an adopted SHR map in the Washoe County Development Code.  The Washoe County Stream Advisory Committee was established by the Board of County Commission (BCC) and began meeting in January 1998.  The idea originated with the Mr. Rose/Geiger Grade Citizen Advisory Board.  (A Citizen Advisory Board is a neighborhood board with members appointed by the BCC to provide advice and recommendations on issues and proposals in the county.)  The Stream Advisory Committee included members with technical expertise who were citizen, developer, water quality, wildlife and public health interest stakeholders.

By 1998, many of the streams in Washoe County were diverted and channeled to provide water for agriculture, without regard to stream structure and condition.  Due to damage and deterioration of the stream environments, and the lack of consideration of the critical role streams play in preserving the quality of Washoe County`s natural environment, the Stream Advisory Committee believed it was important to maintain the natural vegetation along the streams to stabilize banks and maintain the ecological system.  It was understood that confinement by concrete channeling or placement of rip rap prevents the natural processes that produce thriving plant and animal life.  

After more than two years of work of the Stream Advisory Committee, Washoe County staff presented a proposed Development Code Amendment to the Washoe County Planning Commission and, subsequently, to the Board of County Commission.  The proposed amendment was reviewed by Citizen Advisory Boards, developers, contractors and technical experts.  Finally, on February 15, 2001, the amendment was adopted as Washoe County Code.  The amendment provided protection of property from flooding, reduced land development impacts on stream water quality and flows, and provided wildlife mitigation corridors while, at the same time, scrutinized the implications to all parties including whether the ordinance was unfairly burdensome on the property owner or whether the ordinance eliminated all reasonable use of the property. "
"Community Development";"Manufactured Housing";"What is a Trailer (TR) Overlay zone?";"A Trailer (TR) Overlay zone represents the pre-1993 zoning of Washoe County which permitted the setup and subsequent use of a mobile home (pre-1974) or a Housing and Urban Development (HUD) manufactured home (post-1973) as a single family residence.  Any area that had a trailer overlay continues to permit mobile/manufactured homes."
"Community Development";"Manufactured Housing";"What different types of manufactured housing are allowed in the three areas for which regulations are developed?";"For properties zoned for single family residences \"outside Trailer (TR) Overlay zoned areas\", the following limitations apply:
-The unit must be a manufactured house constructed to the HUD standards.
-The unit must be a minimum 1,200 square feet in size.
-The unit must have multiple sections.
-The unit must be no more than 5 years old at time of placement (placement is defined as date of issuance of site inspection permit).
-There may not be Covenants, Conditions or Restrictions (CC&Rs) on the property that restrict manufactured homes.
-The home must be converted to real property.

For properties zoned \"within Trailer (TR) Overlay zoned area\", the following limitations apply:
-The unit may be a manufactured house or a mobile home (a unit constructed to neither the UBC nor HUD code, but not a travel trailer).
-The unit may be of any size.

"Community Development";"Manufactured Housing";"What agency regulates the foundation standards for a manufactured home or a mobile home?";"The State of Nevada Manufactured Housing Division (775.687.4296) regulates foundation requirements.  In addition, county code and state law requires a permanent foundation and subsequently a designation as real property with the Washoe County Assessor`s Office."
"Community Development";"Manufactured Housing";"Are there any aesthetic requirements for manufactured housing in Washoe County?";"The supports must be masked by skirting and/or a perimeter foundation, which must be installed 30 days after the final inspection occurs.  The hitch and wheels must be removed and placed out of sight by the time final inspection occurs."
"Community Development";"Manufactured Housing";"Do the Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions (CC&Rs) on a property limit the placement of a manufactured home?";"The placement of the unit may not violate Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions (CC&Rs); Deed Restrictions; or Negative Covenants that prohibit the placement of the manufactured house within the subdivision within which it is proposed to be located (Washoe County will require an affidavit affirming this at the time of submittal of a setup permit application)."
"Community Development";"Manufactured Housing";"Do I have to build a garage?";"County parking standards must be met.  A garage for at least 1 vehicle must be constructed.  In areas with a previous Trailer (TR) Overlay, the covered parking space may be a carport if there was a mobile/manufactured home on the property within the last 12 months.

"Health";"AIDS/HIV Prevention";"What is HIV?";"Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is the virus that causes AIDS. HIV kills specific white blood cells (T cells), which are an important part of our immune systems. Without treatment, HIV gradually destroys the body`s defenses against disease (it takes an average of 8-10 years), leaving it vulnerable to many infections and cancers. But treatment with antiretroviral drugs can slow or stop the harmful effects of retroviruses like HIV, so that many people with HIV are living longer, healthier lives."
"Health";"AIDS/HIV Prevention";"What is AIDS?";"AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) is a medical condition resulting from HIV infection, usually after many years. By the time a person is given an AIDS diagnosis by a doctor, HIV has seriously damaged the body`s immune system. There are effective treatments to prevent, as well as treat, these serious illnesses."
"Health";"AIDS/HIV Prevention";"HIV is NOT transmitted by:";"Casual Contact.
HIV is a fragile virus outside the body. It quickly becomes inactive when exposed to air, soap and common disinfectants such as bleach.

There is no risk of getting HIV from: 
donating blood 
mosquito bites

hugging 
sharing eating utensils or drinking containers 
food or objects handled by people with HIV or AIDS 
spending time in the same house, business or public place with people who have HIV or AIDS 
"
"Health";"AIDS/HIV Prevention";"Who is at risk for HIV infection?";"Anyone can get HIV if they have unprotected sex or share injection drug equipment with someone who is infected. The virus does not discriminate - it can infect males or females, babies, teens, adults or senior citizens. You cannot look at someone and know they have HIV. In fact, as many as 1 out of 3 people who have HIV (33%) have no idea they are infected."
"Health";"AIDS/HIV Prevention";"Who is eligible for HIV testing at the Washoe County District Health Department?";"To reach those at higher risk for HIV infection and utilize the resources of the WCDHD the following populations are tested at the WCDHD:

-	men who have sex with men 
-	injecting drug users 
-	partners of men who have sex with men 
-	partners of injecting drug users 
-	those who present with an opportunistic infection 
-	contacts (partners) of HIV positive individuals
-	victims of sexual assault

Everyone is eligible and encouraged to seek education and information regarding HIV and STDs.  Educational services are offered free of charge.

</ul>"
"Health";"AIDS/HIV Prevention";"How can HIV transmission from injection drug use be prevented? ";"The best way to avoid HIV infection (and other blood-borne infections like hepatitis B and C) from injection drug use is to stop injecting drugs. Drug treatment can help.  If treatment is not available or you cannot quit on your own, use a brand new sterile syringe and needle every time you inject or divide drugs.   Do not share drug using \"works\" with anyone else. This includes needles, syringes, cookers, cottons, mixing and bleaching water, and all other supplies. If you do not have new clean equipment, thoroughly disinfect all drug use tools with bleach before re-use. It is also important to dispose of used works safely. Discarding needles in the trash, on the street, or flushing them down the toilet is dangerous.

Drug use (including use of alcohol) can impair judgment and decision-making. This can increase risk for HIV, especially if you have sex while high. High or not, you can successfully use condoms and clean injection works. Plan ahead, carry condoms and stick to your prevention plan. 
*A person does not need a prescription to purchase syringes in Nevada.  However, a pharmacist may refuse to sell to people based on their own judgment.
"
"Health";"AIDS/HIV Prevention";"How can sexual transmission of HIV be prevented? ";"The only way to completely avoid the sexual transmission of HIV is to abstain from anal, oral and vaginal sexual. If you choose to have sex, it is safest when you practice monogamy with an uninfected partner. Monogamy is when two people have sex only with each other.
For those with a new sex partner, both can abstain from sex, or use condoms every time during anal, vaginal and oral sex for at least 3 months and then get tested for HIV and other STDs. At that time, if both partners are HIV negative AND both partners are completely avoiding other risk behaviors (e.g., sharing needles or having other sex partners), then unprotected sex with each other is not a risk for HIV transmission.
For someone with an HIV positive partner or a partner who does not know his/her HIV status or multiple sexual partners, touching, dry kissing, body rubbing, and mutual masturbation are the safest sexual activities. However, simple, skin-to-skin touching can spread other STDs.  For any penetrative sex acts such as vaginal, anal or oral sex, condoms are highly effective at reducing the risk of HIV transmission when used consistently and correctly - every time, from beginning to end of each sex act. For more information on condom use see the answer to the question, \"Do condoms provide 100% protection from HIV?\"
"
"Health";"AIDS/HIV Prevention";"What is the HIV Antibody Test?";"There are several types of HIV antibody tests used today. All are highly accurate at detecting HIV antibodies (HIV antibodies are specific proteins made in response to an HIV infection). After infection with HIV, however, it can take up to 3 months for enough HIV antibodies to develop to be detected by the test.

A negative HIV antibody test result means that a person does not have detectable HIV antibodies at the time of the test. Since it can take up to 3 months after HIV infection for enough antibodies to develop, a negative test result is reliable only if the person has not had any sexual or needle-sharing risk behavior (or other exposure to infectious body fluids) during the 3 months prior to testing. Some people with recent risk behavior will test HIV antibody negative, yet may have actually been infected during the previous 3 months. These people will be highly contagious and may easily transmit HIV to their sex and needle-sharing partners.  A high proportion of HIV transmission may occur when people are unaware of their infection. Finally, a negative test result does not mean that a person is safe from future HIV infection. People who test HIV antibody negative are urged to continue to follow HIV prevention guidelines to avoid becoming infected. People who continue risk behaviors are advised to re-test at least every 6 months.

A positive HIV antibody test result means that HIV antibodies are present because the virus is present - the person is infected with HIV (with the exception of newborn babies who are born with their mothers` antibodies). A positive test does not mean the person has AIDS, although many HIV-positive people may develop AIDS in the future. Anyone who tests HIV-positive can transmit the virus to others, regardless of how long they have been infected, whether they have AIDS or other symptoms, or whether their HIV infection is being treated with antiretroviral drugs. It is extremely important that HIV-positive people follow HIV prevention guidelines, not only to protect their partners from getting HIV infection, but also to protect themselves from other germs that could cause HIV/AIDS-related disease.
People at increased risk of HIV infection should NEVER donate blood, plasma, or other organs, or go to such facilities to be tested.
"
"Health";"AIDS/HIV Prevention";"What is the \"window period\" for HIV?";"It can take up to 3 months after HIV infection for enough antibodies to develop, therefore a negative test result is reliable only if the person has not had any sexual or needle-sharing risk behavior (or other exposure to infectious body fluids) during the 3 months prior to testing. Some people with recent risk behavior will test HIV antibody negative, yet may have actually been infected during the previous 3 months.  Every exposure pushes the window period out another months."
"Health";"AIDS/HIV Prevention";"Do condoms provide 100% protection from HIV?";"Condoms are not 100% effective at preventing HIV transmission. When used correctly and consistently, condoms are highly effective and reliable in reducing the risk of transmitting HIV and most sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Condoms should be used EVERY TIME during sex when transmission of HIV (or other STDs) is possible.  When condoms fail to work properly, it is most often because of improper and/or inconsistent use. 

Condoms may not work as well against STDs spread through skin-to-skin touching, like herpes and genital warts, because condoms may not cover the infected areas. 

Following these basic rules will reduce the already small chance of condom failure:
-	Experiment with different condoms and practice putting them on before intercourse. 
-	Practice talking with your partner about your desire and intention to use condoms.
-	Use latex (rubber) or polyurethane (plastic) condoms. Avoid \"natural skin\" condoms, which have tiny holes, which may allow HIV and other STDs to be transmitted.
-	When using a male condom choose one that fits. Male condoms come in different sizes, shapes, and styles, but most condoms will fit most men. 
-	Another choice is the Reality condom, which is made of polyurethane and is designed to fit inside the woman`s vagina for vaginal sex, and the anus for anal sex. Use the directions from the manufacturer that come with Reality condoms. 
-	Open and handle condoms carefully. Never use a condom that is in a damaged package or is past its expiration date. Condoms should be stored loosely in a cool, dry place (not in your wallet or the glove compartment of your car) and kept where you can easily get them if you decide to have sex.
-	To reduce friction that can cause breakage, use plenty of water-based lubricant on the outside of the male latex condom and a small amount on the inside at the tip. With the Reality condom use plenty of lubricant on both the inside and outside. Some condoms come with lubricant, but often there is not enough, so additional lubricant is recommended. Never use oil-based lubricants like Vaseline, hand cream, Crisco, or mineral oil with latex condoms. Oil-based lubricants can rapidly break down latex and allow the virus to pass through. Water-based lubricants include K-Y Jelly, Slippery stuff, ForPlay, Astroglide, ID Lubricants and most contraceptive jellies. These can be found in grocery or drug stores next to the condoms. 
WARNING: Some lubricants contain nonoxynol 9, which can cause irritation. This irritation may increase the risk of HIV transmission. We do NOT advise the use of nonoxynol 9 or products containing it for STD and HIV prevention!

-	The male condom should be put on after erection and before any sexual touch. Remember that pre-cum is also infected with HIV. The Reality condom should go in before sex - it can be inserted up to 8 hours before use. Never use the Reality and the male condoms together or two male condoms at the same time.
-	Some male condoms have a reservoir tip; some don`t. In either case, the tip of the condom should be squeezed while rolling it down onto the penis in order to leave an airless pocket to collect semen. If the penis is natural and has a foreskin, try pulling back the foreskin before unrolling the condom all the way down to the base of the penis. Some men don`t like to pull back the foreskin because they`ve found that the condom slides off when the foreskin is pulled back. If you have trouble with this, consider keeping the foreskin down before putting on the condom or try using a Reality condom with your partner.
-	After intercourse, withdraw the penis while still erect, holding the base of the condom to prevent it from slipping off or spilling semen. Remove the condom and wash the penis with soap and water. 
-	Use a condom only once and dispose of it in the garbage; do not flush condoms down the toilet. Never reuse a condom.
-	Use a condom EVERY TIME during sex when transmission or acquisition of HIV is possible.
"
"Health";"AIDS/HIV Prevention";"What are the symptoms of a new HIV infection?";"Between 50-90% of people with new HIV infections have mild to severe \"flu-like\" symptoms 2 weeks to 3 months from the time of HIV exposure. Others do not have any symptoms. In general, symptoms are not a reliable way to tell if someone has been infected with HIV; the only way to know for sure is to get tested.  Many of the symptoms of early HIV infection are the same as for other, less serious illnesses. People who may have been exposed to HIV should see a doctor promptly if the following symptoms occur within 3 months of the exposure:
-	A persistent fever of over 101 degrees that lasts more than 2 days without a known cause 
-	Constant tiredness
-	Night sweats that soak your pajamas or sheets
-	A persistent rash of unknown cause
-	Persistent swollen glands (lumps under the skin) which occur in several places at once (especially the neck, armpits and groin) 
-	Sore throat
"
"Health";"AIDS/HIV Prevention";"Is there a cure for HIV and AIDS?";"Not at this time. Medical providers have become much better at identifying, monitoring, and treating HIV infection and AIDS. In 1995, a new class of drugs known as protease inhibitors became available. These new medications, used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs, have dramatically improved the health and quality of life for many people living with HIV/AIDS.
While there is not currently a cure or vaccine for HIV/AIDS, there are many things that people living with HIV/AIDS can do to remain healthy and to live longer. The first step for anyone who has HIV infection is to see a knowledgeable, experienced medical provider. This provider will be able to assess and monitor the infection, and, if appropriate, prescribe antiretroviral drugs.
People at increased risk for HIV infection need to be tested for HIV antibodies every 3-6 months. This way they can seek medical care at the earliest possible opportunity if they become infected with HIV. Early detection can also reduce the chance of HIV transmission when people are most infectious.
Although medical care and drugs are expensive, programs exist to ensure that people with HIV infection and AIDS can get the treatment and care they need.

"Health";"Antimicrobial Resistance";"What are bacteria?";"Bacteria (singular: bacterium) are one-celled organisms visible only through a microscope. There are many types of bacteria, only some of which cause disease. Most are harmless and even some are helpful (Â“goodÂ” bacteria), by aiding digestion or breaking down rotting material. Bacteria are found almost everywhere."
"Health";"Antimicrobial Resistance";"What is an antibiotic?";"An antibiotic is a powerful medication designed to kill bacteria or stop them from growing, such as an illness caused by strep throat. They cannot cure illnesses caused by viruses, such as a cold or the flu. Different antibiotics may be used for different types of bacterial infections. Your health care provider will determine what infection you have and if an antibiotic is appropriate to treat it. "
"Health";"Antimicrobial Resistance";"How do antibiotics work?";"Antibiotics either inhibit the growth of bacteria (bacteriostatic) or actually kill the bacteria (bacteriocidal). By stopping the growth of bacteria, it gives the body time to mount an immune response and allows the body to eliminate the bacteria. Drugs that kill the bacteria are the preferred choice when someone has a weakened immune system and whose body cannot destroy the bacteria on its own. Antibiotics are not effective against viruses."
"Health";"Antimicrobial Resistance";"Can antibiotics be harmful?";"Unnecessary antibiotics can be harmful. Antibiotics only fight bacterial infections. They do nothing to help viral illnesses like colds or influenza (flu). If you take an antibiotic when it is not necessary, such as for a cold, you increase the risk of developing an infection caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Antibiotics also destroy Â“goodÂ” bacteria in your body."
"Health";"Antimicrobial Resistance";"What is antibiotic resistance?";"Antibiotic resistance occurs when an antibiotic has lost its ability to effectively control or kill bacterial growth. These bacteria are considered to be Â“resistantÂ” to an antibiotic. Overuse and misuse of antibiotics are the main reason for antibiotic resistance."
"Health";"Antimicrobial Resistance";"How do bacteria become resistant?";"Some bacteria are naturally resistant to certain types of antibiotics. Bacteria can also become resistant by a genetic mutation or by acquiring resistance from another bacterium. Because bacteria can collect multiple resistance traits over time, they can become resistant to many different families of antibiotics, which allows the resistant bacteria to continue to live/and multiply even in the presence of antibiotic treatment."
"Health";"Antimicrobial Resistance";"Do people become resistant to antibiotics?";"No, this is a common misconception. People may exhibit allergic reactions to antibiotics, but they are not resistant to them. It is the bacteria, not the person, which become resistant."
"Health";"Antimicrobial Resistance";"How do I catch an antibiotic-resistant infection?";"There are three ways in which you can get an antibiotic-resistant infection:

    * You can develop antibiotic-resistant infections when you take an antibiotic. The bacteria could figure out how to outsmart the antibiotic and stay alive. In that case, you can transmit these resistant bacteria to others and they too may become ill
    * You can catch antibiotic resistant-infections from people or objects around you that are infected with resistant bacteria. Not properly washing hands can increase your risk of catching all kinds of infections.
    * You can develop an antibiotic-resistant infection when the bacteria inside your body change; it mutates or acquires genes that allow them to resist antibiotic treatment.

Antibiotic-resistant bacteria can also develop in pigs, chickens, cattle and other farm animals, which are exposed to low doses of antibiotics in their daily feed. These resistant bacteria can then spread to humans, causing antibiotic-resistant infections. Guidelines are being developed to address this concern. "
"Health";"Antimicrobial Resistance";"Does a cold or the flu need an antibiotic?";"No. The common cold and the Â“fluÂ” (influenza) are caused by viruses, not by bacteria.. Antibiotics do not work against viruses. Normal cold symptoms include sore throat, fever, cough, and/or a runny nose. A runny nose often starts out with clear drainage and then turns to a green or yellow color. This is a good sign that the body is fighting the virus. If your runny nose is not getting better after 10-14 days, please talk to your healthcare provider."
"Health";"Antimicrobial Resistance";"Does bronchitis need an antibiotic?";"No. Viruses cause most bronchitis."
"Health";"Antimicrobial Resistance";"Do most sore throats need an antibiotic?";" No. Viruses cause most sore throats. Only strep throat needs an antibiotic; it is caused by strep A bacteria."
"Health";"Antimicrobial Resistance";"Do ear infections need antibiotics?";" Sometimes. Viruses and bacteria can cause ear infections. Your doctor may wait to see if the ear infection improves by itself before deciding to give antibiotics."
"Health";"Antimicrobial Resistance";"Do sinus infections need an antibiotic?";"Sometimes. Bacteria or viruses cause sinus infections. Antibiotics are needed for bacterial sinus infections. A bacterial sinus infection may be present if cold symptoms do not improve after 10-14 days."
"Health";"Antimicrobial Resistance";"What can I do to feel better?";"It is very important to have your body help itself. Get plenty of sleep, drink lots of fluids and eat healthy foods. Help decrease the symptoms by using a vaporizer or use over-the-counter medicines like saline nose drops, gargles or throat lozenges. Viral infections simply take time to get better."
"Health";"Antimicrobial Resistance";"Do antibacterial products (such as antibacterial soaps) prevent infections better than ordinary soaps?";"For household use, antibacterial products are no better than ordinary soap for preventing infections. Hand washing for 15 seconds with ordinary soap and water will reduce the risk of most common infections and does not add to antibiotic resistance."
"Health";"Antimicrobial Resistance";"Are antibiotic-resistant bacteria a problem?";" Yes. It is becoming a major public health concern. Each time you take an antibiotic unnecessarily or improperly, you increase your chance of developing drug-resistant bacteria. We could run out of ways to kill disease-causing bacteria.

You don't know who is carrying anti-biotic resistant bacteria and they may pass that resistant bacteria on to you and make you ill. This could mean stronger, more expensive antibiotics, hospitalization and, sometimes, death."
"Health";"Antimicrobial Resistance";"What can I do about antimicrobial resistance?";"Reduce the need for antibiotics.
<ul>
<li>Wash your hands! Wash your hands! And, wash your hands! By washing your hands often and thoroughly with plain soap and water, you are helping to prevent disease and, therefore, the need for antibiotics.</li>
<li>Prevent food borne illnesses by properly refrigerating perishable foods, thoroughly cooking all food from animal sources, and avoiding cross-contamination of other foods.</li>
<li>Consider pets, even if not ill, as potential sources of infection.</li>
<li>Dispose of feces, urine, diapers and contaminated articles properly.</li>
</ul>

Also, you should take antibiotics only when necessary. Don't insist on an antibiotic when your doctor says, \"no\". Never take an antibiotic for a viral infection such as cold, cough, or flu. Take an antibiotic exactly as the doctor prescribes. And take the antibiotic until it is gone, even if you are feeling better. Never save the medication to treat yourself or others later."

"Health";"Condoms and Foam";"What are Condoms and Foam?";"Condoms and Foam work together to help protect you from pregnancy. Condoms help prevent diseases people get from having sex (Sexually Transmitted Diseases). Condoms fit over the manâ€™s erect penis. Sperm are kept inside the condom and canâ€™t get to the womanâ€™s egg.

Condoms and Foam used together give extra protection. Condoms are made of strong latex or plastic. They help keep the manâ€™s sperm out of the womanâ€™s vagina. If the condom breaks or leaks, the foam will help kill the manâ€™s sperm. Condoms also help protect the man and the woman from STDs. Always use condoms every time you have sex. Foam by itself will not protect you from STDs."
"Health";"Condoms and Foam";"How well do Condoms and Foam work?";"Used together, condoms and foam work very well to keep woman from getting pregnant. Between 2 to 15 women out of 100 who use condoms for one year get pregnant. If foam is used by itself, up to 29 women out of 100 may get pregnant."
"Health";"Condoms and Foam";"When does fertility return when using Condoms and Foam?";"There is no interruption in fertility with a woman."

"Health";"Flu";"Will my insurance pay for my flu shot or FluMist?";"Medicare Part B does cover the cost of an annual seasonal flu shot. If you have a senior HMO or another type of insurance or if you want to get FluMist, you should check with your insurance carrier."
"Health";"Flu";"What else will help people avoid getting the flu?";"In addition to getting vaccinated against the flu, there are several simple, common sense actions people can take to decrease the chance of getting and transmitting the flu: 
<ul>
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 30 seconds to eliminate germs you may have picked up from touching things contaminated with the influenza virus. Carry waterless hand sanitizer for use when soap and water are not available.</li>
<li>Avoid touching your mouth and nose Â– many germs, including influenza, enter the body through these openings.</li>
<li>Stay away from crowds. Influenza is transmitted via droplets, which enter the air from a cough or sneeze and can remain airborne for three to six feet. The closer you are to others, the greater your chance of coming into contact with infected airborne particles.</li>
<li>Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze to narrow the distance the droplets travel. Coughing/sneezing into your sleeve eliminates the need for using tissue and washing your hands afterwards.</li>
<li>Stay home from work, school and social gatherings as well as those in the high-risk category if you are not feeling well to avoid the spread of disease to others.</li>
</ul>"
"Health";"Flu";"What are symptoms of the flu?";"Contrary to popular belief, seasonal flu is not a stomach-related illness and, therefore, does <strong>not</strong> cause nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. Instead, seasonal flu is an illness involving the upper respiratory system. Symptoms generally include the following:
<ul>
<li>Body aches</li>
<li>Fever</li>
<li>Sore throat</li>
<li>Runny nose</li>
<li>Dry cough</li>
<li>Fatigue</li>
</ul>
Seasonal influenza symptoms usually come on rapidly and can last for several days. Depending on age and general health status, people who have the flu can pass it along to others for several days before noticing the onset of symptoms and can remain contagious for several days after symptoms subside.  "
"Health";"Flu";"I never get sick, so why should I get a vaccinated for the flu?";"Although most people who have the flu feel quite ill, some people who have the flu do not experience significant symptoms. But even if you donÂ’t have symptoms, you can spread the flu to others, including those at high risk for developing serious complications. Therefore, getting vaccinated protects both you and those around you from getting the flu."
"Health";"Flu";"I`ve gotten flu shots before, and then I got sick with the flu, so I don`t want to get a flu shot again.";"Flu shots are made from killed virus, so getting a flu shot does not cause the flu. 

It takes about two weeks for a flu shot to reach its maximum level of protection. So, if you were exposed to the flu before getting the shot or during the two weeks immediately thereafter, you could experience flu symptoms because you were not protected when you were exposed. Or you could have gotten a strain of the flu that was not included in the current year`s vaccine mix (each year`s mix includes only the three strains believed to be the most likely to circulate during the current season) or you may have gotten a different disease that has similar symptoms.

The most common side effect from the flu shot is soreness at the site of injection. This can be reduced by exercising your arm frequently within the first couple of hours after receiving the shot and throughout the day. "
"Health";"Flu";"Who should <strong>not</strong> get vaccinated against flu?";"<ul>
<li>Infants under 6 months of age because they are too young to receive flu vaccine.</li>
<li>Anyone who has ever had a severe allergic reaction to eggs or any components in flu vaccine.</li>
<li>Anyone who has had Guillain-Barre Syndrome, a neurological disorder.</li>
</ul>"
"Health";"Flu";"What is the Northern Nevada Immunization Coalition?";"The Northern Nevada Immunization CoalitionÂ’s mission is to promote health and decrease the incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases in northern Nevada through community partnerships and education. Established in 1995, the non-profit, community-based coalition is comprised of leaders from various public and private organizations that are working together to improve statewide immunization rates. 

The following members of Partners Promoting Adult Immunizations, a sub-group of the coalition, have made this yearÂ’s local flu shot events possible: Carson City Health and Human Services, Carson Tahoe Regional Healthcare, DonÂ’s Pharmacy, Incline Village Community Hospital, GlaxoSmithKline Vaccines, Maxim Healthcare Services, MedImmune, Merck, Nevada State Health Division, Northern Nevada Medical Center, North Lake Tahoe Fire Protection District, Novartis (formerly Chiron), Orvis Nursing Clinic, RaleyÂ’s, REMSA, the Reno Gazette-Journal, Reno-Sparks Rotary Clubs, Renown (formerly Washoe Medical Center), Saint MaryÂ’s, Sanofi Pasteur (formerly Aventis), UNR Student Health Services, and the Washoe County District Health Department.  "
"Health";"Flu";"How late in the season can I get a seasonal flu shot for it to still be effective?";"While October and November are typically the months when most people get their flu shots, seasonal influenza can begin to increase as early as November or December, but has not reached peak levels in the majority of recent flu seasons in the United States until late December through early March. So getting a seasonal flu shot later than November can still provide protection against seasonal flu. Those in the high-risk category are encouraged to get vaccinated as early in the season as possible to maximize their protection against seasonal flu."
"Health";"Flu";"Will getting a seasonal flu shot protect me from \"bird flu\" or \"pandemic influenza\"?";"No. Â“PandemicÂ” means that many people in many places are becoming ill with the same disease at the same time. A flu pandemic occurs with the emergence of a new flu virus which
<ul>
<li>Spreads easily from person to person</li>
<li>Is not yet preventable through vaccination, as a vaccine cannot be developed until after the new strain emerges.</li>
</ul>
There have been three flu pandemics in the last century. Experts say that we are due for another one. We just donÂ’t know when it will occur.

The Â“bird fluÂ” or Â“avian influenzaÂ” virus has shown the ability to move from birds to people who are in close proximity to infected birds. However, the avian influenza virus of concern (H5N1) has not yet shown the ability to pass easily and sustainably from human to human. If the H5N1 virus mutates to spread easily from person to person to person, it could signal the beginning of a flu pandemic."
"Health";"Food Services";"Are there any food permit exemptions?";"Yes. Coffee (not latte/espresso), tea, prepackaged and unopened non-perishable snacks and candy, canned and bottled soft-drinks and water in original container, canned and bottled pasteurized juices in original container, and whole produce are all exempt from permit."
"Health";"Food Services";"Can I prepare food for a Special Event at home?";"Never. No storage, slicing, dicing, marinating, cooking or any process related to food preparation for any food item, dressing, garnish or other is allowed at a private residence for items served to the general public at a Special Event."
"Health";"Food Services";"Do I still need a permit if I`m giving away food?";"A permit is required if the food has been prepared in a commercial establishment. Food that is prepared in a private home and given away free of charge or consideration of any kind is exempt from the permitting requirement, unless it is given to a commercial food establishment. If you are not sure, it is best to contact the District Health Department at 328-2434."

"Health";"Food Services";"Is there a reduced food permit fee for non-profits?";"Yes, with proof of non-profit status for a temporary food establishment that donates all proceeds to the non-profit agency. (See current Fee Schedule for Environmental Health Services, TEMPORARY FOOD SERVICE, NON-PROFIT."
"Health";"Food Services";"Is there an annual permit to cover a full season for temporary foods?";" No. There is an annual permit for certified produce vendors who wish to sample that applies only to sanctioned Farmer`s Markets. The Washoe County Health District permits and inspects every event separately."
"Health";"Food Services";"If I already have a permit for my restaurant or mobile food do I need a temporary food permit?";"Absolutely; a permit is not transferable from person to person or place to place and unless the operation is conducted from the mobile and contained within the mobile with a menu approval, a separated temporary food permit is required."
"Health";"Food Services";"How far ahead of time must I purchase a Temporary Food Permit?";"There is a late fee that applies if the permit is not purchased at least seven (7) calendar days ahead of time. The District Health Department discourages late applications and may deny applicants that are chronically late."
"Health";"Food Services";"If I turn in a food permit application and pay the fee, have I been approved?";"No. The application is subject to review and food service operations must comply with regulations. Incomplete applications may be rejected. Applications may also be rejected based on inability to contact the person in charge of food service, menu item restrictions, or operational concerns."
"Health";"Food Services";"Can I prepare the food for a Special Event ahead of time at an approved facility?";" Advanced preparation must be approved by the Health Department ahead of time as per application. Menu items, storage, transport, time and temperature will all be considered before such approval is granted. Cooking and cooling food items prior to an event is usually not allowed."
"Health";"Green, Yellow, Red Burn Code Program";"What is the Green, Yellow, Red Burn Code Program?";"In 1987, the Washoe County Air Quality Management Division (AQMD) developed this program to reduce the emissions from woodstoves and fireplaces during wintertime high pollution episodes.  One of three burn code colors is issued each day based on the current and forecasted air quality.  Each color lets you know if you can light your stove or fireplace.  The Burn code address all solid fuels including wood, pellets, fire logs, coal, etc.

<b>Green</b> - When the Air Quality Index (AQI) is in the Good or low to mid Moderate range, the burn code is Green and that means itâ€™s okay to light a fire in your stove or fireplace.  But keep in mind that you should always burn seasoned wood.

<b>Yellow</b> - Slow down on the amount of wood you burn or stop burning altogether.  When the AQI reaches the upper end of the Moderate range, the burn code switches to Yellow.  This is still a voluntary stage, but if you stop burning wood now, it may be possible to avoid worse pollution tomorrow.

<b>Red</b> - When the AQI exceeds 100, itâ€™s Red and that means stop all residential and commercial burning immediately.  If weather forecasts show little chance of the temperature inversion lifting, the District Health Officer will call a Stage 1 Episode prohibiting burning for 24 hours, or until weather patterns change and the pollution levels decrease.

The program is in effect from November through February and applies to Southern Washoe County from Cold Springs to Washoe Valley."
"Health";"Green, Yellow, Red Burn Code Program";"What areas are affected by the Green, Yellow, Red Burn Code Program?";"The Burn Code applies to businesses and residences located in the following ZIP codes:

89431, 89433, 89434, 89436, 89439, 89441, 89501, 89502, 89503, 89506, 89509, 89511, 89512, 89519, 89521, 89523, 89595, 89704"
"Health";"Green, Yellow, Red Burn Code Program";"Why is the burn code restriction necessary?";"In the Truckee Meadows, wood burning accounts for nearly 50 percent of wintertime fine particulate matter.  The purpose of the Green, Yellow, Red Burn Code Program is to reduce the harmful emissions that come from wood burning.  The Air Quality Management Division (AQMD) provides a daily burn code which tells residents when burning is restricted or prohibited during the months of November through February.  We all breathe unhealthy air when weather conditions trap pollution close to the ground during the fall and winter months.  Itâ€™s the AQMDâ€™s responsibility to protect public health and achieve clean air goals."
"Health";"Green, Yellow, Red Burn Code Program";"What are the health effects of breathing fine particulate matter like wood smoke?";"Fine particulate matter is a complex mixture that may contain soot, smoke, metals, nitrates, sulfates and dust.  Studies have linked long-term exposure to particle pollution, especially fine particles, with serious health problems including decreased lung function, aggravated asthma, development of chronic respiratory disease in children (asthma), irregular heartbeat, nonfatal heart attacks, premature death in people with heart or lung disease and increased susceptibility to heart and vascular disease for post-menopausal women.  In addition, new health studies have shown that breathing wood smoke reduces the blood's ability to clot, and specifically for children it lowers IQ and decreases memory.  Children are more likely to suffer effects because their respiratory systems are developing and they breathe more air per pound of body weight."
"Health";"Green, Yellow, Red Burn Code Program";"How will these burn code restrictions affect me?";"On days when the air quality is forecast to be unhealthy, residents and businesses in Washoe County are prohibited from using stoves and fireplaces that burn wood, pellets, manufactured logs, or any other type of solid fuel.  In the winter of 2009-2010, the Air Quality Management Division issued ten Red burn codes."
"Health";"Green, Yellow, Red Burn Code Program";"Are there exemptions for the burn code?";"The following exemptions apply to the Red burn code:
<ul>
<li>Homes in ZIP codes OUTSIDE the burn restriction area;</li>

"Health";"Minipill";"How soon does the Minipill work?";"Use a backup method of birth control every time you have sex during the first seven days after you take your first pill."
"Health";"Minipill";"How does the Minipill work?";"The Minipill stops the ovaries from releasing eggs in about half of the cycles. It makes the cervical mucus at the entrance to the uterus thick so that it is hard for sperm to reach the egg. They also affect other hormones, the fallopian tubes and the lining of the uterus."
"Health";"Minipill";"How effective is the Minipill?";"About 1 out of every 200 women using the Minipill will get pregnant in the first year if they take it every day at the same time. For women who occasionally miss taking pills or don`t take them at the same time every day, 1 out of every 20 will get pregnant."
"Health";"Minipill";"When does fertility return after stopping the Minipill?";"Immediately. The Minipill does not delay your ability to get pregnant after you stop taking it."
"Health";"Minipill";"Can the Minipill be used by nursing mothers?";"Yes. The Minipill will not affect the quality or amount of your breast milk or the health of your nursing baby. If you are breastfeeding you may start the Minipill 6 weeks after delivery (after your postpartum checkup). The Minipill works most effectively for mothers that are exclusively breastfeeding (not giving your baby food or formula)."
"Health";"Minipill";"What do I do if I miss a pill?";"If you miss taking one or two pills, or are more than 3 hours late taking your pill follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Take a missed pill/pills as soon as you remember that you missed it.</li>
<li>Go back to taking your pills at your regular time.</li>
<li>Use a backup method of birth control (like condoms) every time you have sex for the next 48 hours.</li>
</ol>
If you miss more than two pills do not take your missed pills. Continue taking your pills as normal, and use a back-up method until you can talk to your health care provider."
"Health";"Minipill";"What are the benefits of using the Minipill?";"The Minipill is recommended for breastfeeding women, and because it has less serious side effects than the regular birth control pills, it can be taken by women who should not use estrogen (women who have high blood pressure, and smokers over age 35)."
"Health";"Minipill";"What are the possible side effects of the Minipill?";"Changes in menstrual period. You may have spotting, irregular periods or no periods.

You may experience tender breasts.

The Minipill may cause dark patches on the skin of your face. These patches may continue even after you stop using the Minipill and may become worse with sun exposure."
"Health";"Minipill";"What are the risks of using the Minipill?";"Women who use contraceptives with hormones (like the Minipill) have an increased risk of blood clots or stroke. There is also an increased chance of ectopic pregnancy meaning that the fetus develops outside the uterus. Although possible, these events are rare.

Women using the Minipill also have an increased chance of developing ovarian cysts."
"Health";"Minipill";"Who should not use the Minipill?";"Any woman who:
<ul>
<li>Is pregnant or suspects pregnancy</li>
<li>Has undiagnosed, irregular bleeding between periods</li>
<li>Has liver disease or liver tumors</li>
<li>Has or suspects breast or uterine cancer</li>

"Health";"Mirena";"What is the Mirena?";"Mirena is a flexible T-shaped unit that is placed inside the uterus, where it stays until removed by a health care professional. It contains a progestin hormone that is constantly released in the uterus. It is used to prevent pregnancy and can do so for five years, or until it is removed."
"Health";"Mirena";"How is Mirena inserted?";"A health care professional will clean your vagina and cervix and then insert a thin tube of flexible plastic into your uterus. Inside the tube is the Mirena. When Mirena is in place in the uterus, the tube will be removed. Most women experience some discomfort during insertion. Insertion takes only a few minutes."
"Health";"Mirena";"How does Mirena work?";"There is no single explanation of how Mirena works. It may stop release of your egg from your ovary, but this is not the way it works in most cases. It may block sperm from reaching or fertilizing your egg. It may make the lining of your uterus thin. We do not know which of these actions is most important for preventing pregnancy and most likely all of them work together."
"Health";"Mirena";"How soon does Mirena work?";"Mirena is effective at preventing pregnancy as soon as it is inserted, although a back-up method (like condoms) is recommended until the IUD check 4-6 weeks after insertion."
"Health";"Mirena";"How effective is Mirena?";"Less that 1 out of every 100 women using Mirena become pregnant while using it."
"Health";"Mirena";"Will Mirena affect my period?";"Yes. For the first 3 to 6 months you will have frequent spotting or light bleeding in addition to your period. Your period may become irregular in the first 6 months, and a few women have heavy periods that last longer than normal.

After your body adjusts, your periods get shorter and you may even stop having periods. This is not harmful to your body."
"Health";"Mirena";"When does fertility return after stopping Mirena?";"Your normal ability to become pregnant returns as soon as Mirena is removed. Your health care professional can remove Mirena at any time."
"Health";"Mirena";"Can Mirena be used by nursing mothers?";"Yes. Mirena is thought to be safe for breastfeeding women."
"Health";"Mirena";"What are the benefits of using the Mirena?";"Mirena is effective for 5 years. It can decrease the blood loss, cramping and length of periods. It can also decrease anemia, or low iron levels in the blood."
"Health";"Mirena";"What are the possible side effects of Mirena?";"There are many side effects of Mirena. The most common are: changes in your period, lower abdominal pain, acne or other skin problems, back pain, breast tenderness, headache, mood changes, and nausea.

Other side effects are possible. Talk with your nurse for more information."
"Health";"Mirena";"What are the risks of using Mirena?";"Although rare, some Mirena users get a serious pelvic infection called Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID). PID can cause serious problems like infertility, ectopic pregnancy or constant pelvic pain.

Mirena may go through the uterus, which would require surgery to remove it.

Ovarian cysts have been diagnosed in about 12% of Mirena users. These usually go away on their own in a few months, but they can cause pain and sometimes require surgery.

Mirena may also come out of place by itself. You could get pregnant if this happens.

Other risks of using Mirena include cramps, dizziness and faintness with insertion; increased chance of a pregnancy outside of the uterus if a pregnancy does occur, and severe and life-threatening infection after insertion."
"Health";"Mirena";"Who cannot use Mirena?";"Any woman who:
<ul>
<li>Is pregnant or suspects pregnancy</li>
<li>Might have cancer of the uterus or cervix</li>
<li>Has undiagnosed, irregular bleeding between periods</li>
<li>Has serious liver disease or tumor</li>
<li>Has ever had breast cancer</li>

"Health";"Natural Family Planning";"What are Fertility Awareness Methods (FAM)?";"A woman is fertile (able to get pregnant) only for a rather short time during each menstrual cycle. For most of the cycle, she should be infertile (not able to get pregnant). A woman or couple may learn how to tell fertile days from infertile days by checking the womanâ€™s bodily signs daily and keeping a chart of the changes.

FAM consist of those methods used by women to estimate the time of month they are most fertile (about seven days in length) this is the time when you could get pregnant. Some women choose to avoid sexual intercourse during the time of the month when they are most likely to become pregnant. This is called periodic abstinence. Other women choose to use one or more contraceptive methods during their fertile time. FAMs are named after the method a woman uses to recognize her fertile days. These include: Natural family planning, Sympto-Thermal Method, Ovulation method, Mucus/Temperature and/or Rhythm."
"Health";"Natural Family Planning";"How do Fertility Awareness Methods work?";"It is based on the fact that a woman is fertile only around the time of ovulation (the release of a ripe egg from an ovary). It relies on the following beliefs:
<ul>
<li>An egg is usually released each cycle</li>
<li>The egg is released about 14 days before the menstruation cycle</li>
<li>The egg lives 12-24 hours, and after the sperm get into a womanâ€™s reproductive system, they might be able to fertilize (join) an egg for up to five days</li>
</ul>
This means that a woman is fertile for as long as five days before ovulation due to sperm life and after ovulation she is considered fertile for two to three days. This means that the woman is fertile for seven to eight days of her cycle each month. The remaining days are not believed to be fertile days, and intercourse during that part of the cycle should not result in pregnancy. The aim of FAM is to recognize when the ovulation is approaching (fertile phase begins) and when it has passed (fertile phase ends)."
"Health";"Natural Family Planning";"How effective are Fertility Awareness Methods?";"Pregnancy rates vary depending on whether one method or combinations of methods of FAM are used, or whether barrier methods are added during the fertile time. FAM is most effective with no intercourse during the fertile phase. About 24 out of 100 who are average users and rely on FAM with periodic abstinence may become pregnant each year.

Careful and consistent use can give better results. To make the method work best for you, you should talk to your healthcare professional."
"Health";"Natural Family Planning";"What are the benefits of using Fertility Awareness Methods?";"<ul>
<li>The method has no health risks or side effects for the woman.</li>
<li>It can be used to prevent or to plan a pregnancy.</li>
<li>It can be quite effective if used correctly and consistently, especially if you have regular periods.</li>
<li>It is acceptable for couples with religious concerns about birth control.</li>
<li>The method is free, except for a thermometer (and possibly a class fee and purchased charts).</li>
<li>It can lead to greater awareness and understanding of the body.</li>
<li>Couples may develop greater communication, cooperation and responsibility.</li>
<li>Barrier methods that have very few side effects may be uses with FAM during the fertile period to increase the effectiveness of pregnancy prevention.</li>
</ul>"
"Health";"Natural Family Planning";"What are possible disadvantages of Fertility Awareness Methods?";"<ul>
<li>Even with correct use, the failure rate is often higher than with other methods. If the method is not used correctly and consistently, pregnancy is risked.</li>
<li>Learning the method takes time and effort.</li>
<li>Using the method requires considerable commitment, calculations and self-control.</li>
<li>Both the woman and her partner must use self-control, unless a barrier method is added during the fertile period.</li>
<li>If the woman or her partner has other sexual partners there is the risk of transmitting (passing on) a sexually transmitted disease.</li>

"Health";"Smoking Ban";"Why was the smoking ban passed?";"The ban was passed in order to protect the public from secondhand smoke. Secondhand smoke, also called environmental tobacco smoke, is a combination of smoke from the burning end of a cigarette, cigar or pipe and the smoke exhaled by smokers.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
reports that secondhand smoke contains more than 4,000 substances, many of which are known to cause cancer in humans. In 2006, the <a href=\"http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/secondhandsmoke/\">U.S. Surgeon General released a comprehensive report</a> stating that there is no risk-free level of secondhand smoke exposure."

A temporary restraining order (TRO) was issued that prohibited the Southern Nevada Health District from enforcing the smoking ban at those 20 businesses.  The TRO did not cancel the law. The TRO was lifted on December 19, 2006. 
	
On January 23, 2007, at the request of the state Attorney General, the Eighth Judicial District Court held a hearing on the constitutionality of the smoking ban.  The Court ruled that the smoking ban is constitutional.  However, the Court removed the law's criminal penalties <strong>in Clark County only</strong>.  In the rest of Nevada, it is legal to implement the law with both civil and criminal penalties.  

At this time, the only way the law would change at a statewide level is through the State Supreme Court. "
"Health";"Smoking Ban";"How will the ban improve the health of Washoe County?";"Exposure to secondhand smoke has been linked to numerous life-threatening diseases such as heart attack, stroke, and cancer.  Eliminating smoking in indoor spaces reduces exposure to secondhand smoke, thereby reducing the occurrence of these chronic illnesses.  Research in communities that have implemented indoor smoking bans shows significant improvement to public health after the ban goes into effect.  For example, hospital admissions for heart attacks dropped 40 percent in the six months following an indoor smoking ban in Helena, Montana; and, in Pueblo, Colorado, heart attacks declined 30 percent in 18 months after smoking was banned indoors."
"Health";"Smoking Ban";"How have smoking bans in other communities affected business owners?";"Banning smoking in indoor spaces has been shown to have a positive impact for business owners in addition to the general community.  Studies have shown that banning smoking in restaurants and bars can boost revenues and increase employment.  For example, taxable sales receipts for bars and restaurants have increased every year in California since their smoking ban took effect in 2002.  In New York City, tax receipts for restaurant and bars increased 8.7 percent, and employment increased by 10,600 jobs since their 2003 smoking ban went into effect; and, in Florida, retail sales for restaurants, lunchrooms, and catering services increased by 7.3 percent after a 2003 smoking ban.  FloridaÂ’s sales and employment in the hotel, restaurant, and tourism industries also were not hurt.  Smoking bans in places of employment also have been shown to lower employee sick leave usage, health insurance costs, fire insurance rates, and cleaning costs.

Many studies have been conducted about the business impact of indoor smoking bans.  For more information about these studies, please visit: www.tobaccoscam.ucsf.edu."
"Health";"Smoking Ban";"What will it cost business owners to comply with the smoking ban?";"The cost to comply with the law will vary for each business, but, in general, there are minimal costs.  Employers must clearly and conspicuously post \"No Smoking\" signs in their facilities at every entrance.  They also are required to remove all ashtrays and other smoking paraphernalia from any area where smoking is prohibited.

"Health";"Smoking Ban";"I smoke, so how does the smoking ban apply to me?";"Smokers play an important role in helping to implement the new law.  First and foremost, it is now illegal for you to smoke indoors in a facility where smoking has been banned.  Even if a \"No Smoking\" sign is not displayed there, you are still required by law to refrain from smoking.  You should also not bring any ashtrays or items used as ashtrays into a facility where smoking is now banned.  You may still smoke anywhere outside of a facility where smoking is now banned indoors.  You may also still smoke indoors at the following types of businesses:
<ol>
<li>Areas within casinos where loitering by minors is already prohibited by state law;</li>
<li>Stand-alone bars, taverns, and saloons that do not require a permit to serve food;</li>
<li>Strip clubs and brothels;</li>
<li>Retail tobacco stores;</li>
<li>Private residences, including those which may serve as an office workplace, except if used as a childcare, an adult day care, or a health care facility; and</li>
<li>Hotel and motel rooms, but only if allowed by the facility operator, so please ask the operator first before smoking there.</li>
</ol>
If you are uncertain about being able to smoke indoors, please ask the owner and/or manager of the facility first before smoking there. Your compliance with the new law helps protect non-smokers and children from the dangers of secondhand smoke.  Your compliance also helps merchants meet their responsibilities under the new law.  If you are asked by a representative of the business to refrain from smoking inside their facility, please do as they ask.  It is the business's responsibility to enforce the new law in their establishment; if you are found smoking indoors at a location where smoking is now banned, then the business itself could be cited and required to pay a fine.  You, too, could be found guilty of a misdemeanor, which generally carries a fine imposed by a judge. A person who violates this ban is also liable for a civil penalty of $100 for each violation."
"Health";"Smoking Ban";"Why is the Health Department involved in the smoking ban?";"Sec. 2 (7) of the new law states that Â“Health authorities, police officers of cities or towns, sheriffs and their deputies shall, within their respective jurisdictions, enforce the provisions of this Act and shall issue citations for violations of this Act[.]Â” The District Health Department is the health authority for Washoe County (per NRS 202.2485). Therefore, the District Health Department is required by law to enforce the smoking ban."
"Health";"Smoking Ban";"If the law refers to \"public places,\" then why is smoking banned in businesses that are privately owned?";"Sec. 2 (9) (d) of the new law defines \"public places\" as \"any enclosed areas to which the public is invited or in which the public is permitted.\"  If a business meets this definition, then smoking must be banned there indoors, regardless of how the facility is owned.  
	
The law also defines a \"place of employment\" in Sec. 2 (9) (i) as \"any enclosed area under the control of a public or private employer which employees frequent during the course of employment including, but not limited to, work areas, restrooms, hallways, employee lounges, cafeterias, conference and meeting rooms, lobbies and reception areas.\" Again, if a business meets this definition, then smoking must be banned indoors as described, regardless of how the facility is owned. The law does make an exception in Sec. 2 (3) (e) for private residences that serve as workplaces, except if they are being used as a childcare, adult day care, or health care facility."
"Health";"Smoking Ban";"What is \"smoking-related paraphernalia\"?";"Ashtrays or any items being used as an ashtray (e.g., beer bottles, coffee mugs, discarded trash, etc.) are considered smoking-related paraphernalia and must be removed from any area where smoking is prohibited. Merchants may still sell tobacco products."
"Health";"Smoking Ban";"Are businesses in Washoe County complying with the smoking ban?";"Staff from the Environmental Health Services Division of the District Health Department have been conducting smoking ban compliance surveys during routine inspections since December 19, 2006.  To date, an average 96.5% of permitted facilities were in compliance with the requirements set forth in the NCIAA during routine Environmental Health Services permit inspections."
"Health";"Smoking Ban";"Can a business allow smoking during certain times of the day?";"No. The NCIAA states: Â“Smoking tobacco in any form is prohibited within indoor places of employment including, but not limited to, the following:
<ol style=\"list-style-type: lower-alpha;\">
<li>Child care facilities;</li>
<li>Movie theatres;</li>
<li>Video arcades;</li>
<li>Government buildings and public places;</li>

There are no provisions for allowing smoking, at any time, in any of the above locations."
"Health";"Smoking Ban";"Four ways to ask smokers to \"take it outside\":";"Asking strangers, and sometimes even friends and family, to smoke outside can sometimes be stressful.  It is important to remember that the vast majority of people are respectful and will abide by the law, if they are aware and reminded of it.  Below are 4 ways to ask people who smoke to \"take it outside\".  It may not be easy at first but you have the right and the responsibility to avoid secondhand smoke.
<ol>
<li>As the business owner/manager to enforce the law: I thought this was a non-smoking business.  Would you please ask them to smoke outside?</li>
<li>Remind them of the law: Maybe you didn`t know, but Nevada law prohibits smoking in this area/building/business.  Smoking is allowed outside.</li>
<li>Be polite: I would like to ask a favor.  Would you mind smoking outside?  This is a non-smoking area.</li>
<li>It is the smoke, not the smoker that is the problem: Would you not smoke right now? I`d really appreciate it.</li>

"Health";"STD";"What are STDs?";"Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) are diseases that are spread through anal, oral or vaginal intercourse.  Sharing drug injection equipment can also transmit some STDs such as HIV and Hepatitis B.  
Common STDs include:  
Chlamydia,  
Gonorrhea,  
Hepatitis A Virus (HAV),
Hepatitis B Virus (HBV),
Hepatitis C Virus (HCV),
Herpes Simplex Virus (Herpes), 
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), 
Human Papilloma Virus (Genital Warts), 
Molluscum Contagiosum, 
Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID), 
Pubic Lice, 
Scabies, 
Syphilis, 
and Trichomoniasis.
"
"Health";"STD";"Consequences of STDs.";"Some STDs are easily treated and some STDs stay with you for life.  Other STDs are more of a nuisance than a health risk.  Pubic lice, or `crabs,` for example, itch a lot but don`t do any permanent damage.  If you get an infection and you want to know how serious it could be, talk with your health care provider. 
There are four serious health consequences of some STDs: 
Â§	Blockage of the fallopian tubes which can lead to infertility and ectopic pregnancy
Â§	Pregnancy loss and increased newborn deaths caused by transmission of the infection to the infant during pregnancy and childbirth  
Â§	Genital cancers for males and females  
Â§	Enhanced transmission of HIV/AIDS
Social and Psychological Consequences: 
The psychological impact of having a sexually transmitted disease can be severe. Some persons become depressed or anxious.  They fear recurrent outbreaks, transmission to sex partners, and difficulties in developing new relationships.  Fortunately, proper treatment and knowledge about the true risks can greatly lessen all these effects.  
"
"Health";"STD";"What is HIV?";"Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is the virus that causes AIDS. HIV kills specific white blood cells (T cells), which are an important part of our immune systems. Without treatment, HIV gradually destroys the body`s defenses against disease (it takes an average of 8-10 years), leaving it vulnerable to many infections and cancers. But treatment with antiretroviral drugs can slow or stop the harmful effects of retroviruses like HIV, so that many people with HIV are living longer, healthier lives."
"Health";"STD";"What is AIDS?";"AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) is a medical condition resulting from HIV infection, usually after many years. By the time a person is given an AIDS diagnosis by a doctor, HIV has seriously damaged the body`s immune system. There are effective treatments to prevent, as well as treat, these serious illnesses."
"Health";"STD";"How is HIV transmitted?";"HIV can be transmitted when blood, semen (including pre-seminal fluid or pre-cum), vaginal fluids, or breast milk from an infected person enters the body of an uninfected person. HIV must get into the bloodstream or body in order to cause infection.
Transmission most often occurs during unprotected sex or during injection drug use when equipment is shared. An infected woman who becomes pregnant can transmit HIV to her baby during pregnancy or during birth, but this risk is significantly less if the woman takes antiretroviral drugs. She can also pass HIV to her newborn if she breastfeeds. Anyone infected with HIV can transmit it, whether or not they appear sick, have an AIDS diagnosis, or are successfully treating their infection with antiretroviral drugs. 
HIV is spread in the following ways:
Unprotected anal, vaginal or oral sex
HIV can enter the body during sex through the anus, vagina, opening at the end of the penis or mouth and through cuts, sores and abrasions on the skin. Unprotected anal and vaginal sex have the highest risk of infection. There are a growing number of reported cases where HIV has been transmitted during oral sex (mouth to genital contact), but oral sex is much less risky than anal or vaginal sex.

Anyone having unprotected sex (inserting or receiving partner) with an infected person is at risk of getting HIV. The person most at risk is the receiving partner. Heterosexually, women are at higher risk than men.

Blood exposure.
Sharing needles or drug injection equipment can transmit HIV (and other viruses like hepatitis). After use, small amounts of blood can remain in the used needles, syringes, cookers, cottons, and water. This remaining blood can enter the body of the next user when any of these items are shared. If this blood is HIV infected, transmission can easily occur. 

There is a very small but real risk of health care workers getting HIV from infected patients as a result of needle stick accidents or when blood gets into a worker`s open cut or a mucous membrane in their eyes, mouth or nose. The risk for health care workers is greatly reduced when universal precautions are carefully followed, such as safe disposal of sharps, wearing latex gloves, etc. Universal precautions also protect patients.

Very rarely in this country is HIV transmitted when receiving a blood transfusion, blood clotting factors, an organ or tissue transplant (the risk of acquiring HIV from a blood transfusion is approximately 1 in a million). Before 1985, there were no tests to screen blood and organ donations for HIV. Now, blood, organ and tissue banks extensively test all specimens for HIV and other blood-borne germs.

Mother to child
If a woman is infected with HIV, she can give it to her baby during pregnancy, during birth, or by breastfeeding. Early in the epidemic, 25% (1 out of 4) of babies born to HIV-infected women in this country became infected with HIV. Now, in developed countries where early detection of HIV is possible, treatment with the latest antiretroviral medications can reduce this rate to about 1% (1 out of 100). All pregnant women should see a doctor, be tested for HIV, and if infected, obtain the best treatment. 
"
"Health";"STD";"HIV is not transmitted by..?";"Casual Contact.
HIV is a fragile virus outside the body. It quickly becomes inactive when exposed to air, soap and common disinfectants such as bleach.

There is no risk of getting HIV from: 
donating blood, 
mosquito bites, 
toilet seats, 
shaking hands, 
hugging, 
sharing eating utensils or drinking containers, 
food or objects handled by people with HIV or AIDS, 
spending time in the same house, and business or public place with people who have HIV or AIDS 
"
"Health";"STD";"Who is at risk for HIV infection?";"Anyone can get HIV if they have unprotected sex or share injection drug equipment with someone who is infected. The virus does not discriminate - it can infect males or females, babies, teens, adults or senior citizens. You cannot look at someone and know they have HIV. In fact, as many as 1 out of 3 people who have HIV (33%) have no idea they are infected."
"Health";"STD";"Who is eligible for HIV testing at the Washoe County Health District?";"The following populations are tested at the WCHD:

Anyone over the age of 12 considered at risk for HIV infections, sexually active individuals, those with current or history of STDs and their partners, men who have sex with men, injecting drug users, partners of men who have sex with men, partners of injecting drug users, those who present with an opportunistic infection, contacts (partners) of HIV positive individuals, and victims of sexual assault.

For an HIV appointment at the District Health Department, call 328-2470. 

Everyone is eligible and encouraged to seek education and information regarding HIV and STDs.  Educational services are offered free of charge."
"Health";"STD";"What are the costs of an HIV test or STD exam at the Health Department? ";"Members of the community that access HIV and STD testing at the WCDHD are charged on a sliding fee scale, based on income.  Charges are based on how much time is spent with the nurse and what testing is done."
"Health";"STD";"Where else is HIV testing available in the community? ";"HIV testing is available from a variety of resources in the community:  

-Private health care provider

"
"Health";"STD";"How can HIV transmission from injection drug use be prevented? ";"The best way to avoid HIV infection (and other blood-borne infections like hepatitis B and C) from injection drug use is to stop injecting drugs. Drug treatment can help.  If treatment is not available or you cannot quit on your own, use a brand new sterile syringe and needle every time you inject or divide drugs.   Do not share drug using \"works\" with anyone else. This includes needles, syringes, cookers, cottons, mixing and bleaching water, and all other supplies. If you do not have new clean equipment, thoroughly disinfect all drug use tools with bleach before re-use. It is also important to dispose of used works safely. Discarding needles in the trash, on the street, or flushing them down the toilet is dangerous.

Drug use (including use of alcohol) can impair judgment and decision-making. This can increase risk for HIV, especially if you have sex while high. High or not, you can successfully use condoms and clean injection works. Plan ahead, carry condoms and stick to your prevention plan. 
A person does not need a prescription to purchase syringes in Nevada.  However, a pharmacist may refuse to sell to people based on their own judgment.
"
"Health";"STD";"How can sexual transmission of HIV be prevented? ";"The only way to completely avoid the sexual transmission of HIV is to abstain from anal, oral and vaginal sexual. 

If you choose to have sex, it is safest when you practice monogamy with an uninfected partner. Monogamy is when two people have sex only with each other.

For those with a new sex partner, both can abstain from sex, or use condoms every time during anal, vaginal and oral sex for at least 3 months and then get tested for HIV and other STDs. At that time, if both partners are HIV negative AND both partners are completely avoiding other risk behaviors (e.g., sharing needles or having other sex partners), then unprotected sex with each other is not a risk for HIV transmission.

For someone with an HIV positive partner or a partner who does not know his/her HIV status or multiple sexual partners, touching, dry kissing, body rubbing, and mutual masturbation are the safest sexual activities. However, simple, skin-to-skin touching can spread other STDs.  

For any penetrative sex acts such as vaginal, anal or oral sex, condoms are highly effective at reducing the risk of HIV transmission when used consistently and correctly - every time, from beginning to end of each sex act. 

For more information on condom use see the answer to the question, \"Do condoms provide 100% protection from HIV?\"
"
"Health";"STD";"What is the HIV Antibody Test?";"There are several types of HIV antibody tests used today. All are highly accurate at detecting HIV antibodies (HIV antibodies are specific proteins made in response to an HIV infection). After infection with HIV, however, it can take up to 3 months for enough HIV antibodies to develop to be detected by the test.

A negative HIV antibody test result means that a person does not have detectable HIV antibodies at the time of the test. Since it can take up to 3 months after HIV infection for enough antibodies to develop, a negative test result is reliable only if the person has not had any sexual or needle-sharing risk behavior (or other exposure to infectious body fluids) during the 3 months prior to testing. Some people with recent risk behavior will test HIV antibody negative, yet may have actually been infected during the previous 3 months. These people will be highly contagious and may easily transmit HIV to their sex and needle-sharing partners.  A high proportion of HIV transmission may occur when people are unaware of their infection. Finally, a negative test result does not mean that a person is safe from future HIV infection. People who test HIV antibody negative are urged to continue to follow HIV prevention guidelines to avoid becoming infected. People who continue risk behaviors are advised to re-test at least every 6 months.

A positive HIV antibody test result means that HIV antibodies are present because the virus is present - the person is infected with HIV (with the exception of newborn babies who are born with their mothers` antibodies). A positive test does not mean the person has AIDS, although many HIV-positive people may develop AIDS in the future. Anyone who tests HIV-positive can transmit the virus to others, regardless of how long they have been infected, whether they have AIDS or other symptoms, or whether their HIV infection is being treated with antiretroviral drugs. It is extremely important that HIV-positive people follow HIV prevention guidelines, not only to protect their partners from getting HIV infection, but also to protect themselves from other germs that could cause HIV/AIDS-related disease.
People at increased risk of HIV infection should NEVER donate blood, plasma, or other organs, or go to such facilities to be tested.
"
"Health";"STD";"What is the \"window period\" for HIV?";"It can take up to 3 months after HIV infection for enough antibodies to develop, therefore a negative test result is reliable only if the person has not had any sexual or needle-sharing risk behavior (or other exposure to infectious body fluids) during the 3 months prior to testing. Some people with recent risk behavior will test HIV antibody negative, yet may have actually been infected during the previous 3 months.  Every exposure pushes the window period out another months."
"Health";"STD";"Do condoms provide 100% protection from HIV?";"Condoms are not 100% effective at preventing HIV transmission. When used correctly and consistently, condoms are highly effective and reliable in reducing the risk of transmitting HIV and most sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Condoms should be used EVERY TIME during sex when transmission of HIV (or other STDs) is possible.  When condoms fail to work properly, it is most often because of improper and/or inconsistent use. 

Condoms may not work as well against STDs spread through skin-to-skin touching, like herpes and genital warts, because condoms may not cover the infected areas. 

Following these basic rules will reduce the already small chance of condom failure:

-Experiment with different condoms and practice putting them on before intercourse. 

-Practice talking with your partner about your desire and intention to use condoms.

-Use latex (rubber) or polyurethane (plastic) condoms. Avoid \"natural skin\" condoms, which have tiny holes, which may allow HIV and other STDs to be transmitted.

-When using a male condom choose one that fits. Male condoms come in different sizes, shapes, and styles, but most condoms will fit most men. 

-Another choice is the Reality condom, which is made of polyurethane and is designed to fit inside the woman`s vagina for vaginal sex, and the anus for anal sex. Use the directions from the manufacturer that come with Reality condoms. 

-Open and handle condoms carefully. Never use a condom that is in a damaged package or is past its expiration date. Condoms should be stored loosely in a cool, dry place (not in your wallet or the glove compartment of your car) and kept where you can easily get them if you decide to have sex.

-To reduce friction that can cause breakage, use plenty of water-based lubricant on the outside of the male latex condom and a small amount on the inside at the tip. With the Reality condom use plenty of lubricant on both the inside and outside. Some condoms come with lubricant, but often there is not enough, so additional lubricant is recommended. Never use oil-based lubricants like Vaseline, hand cream, Crisco, or mineral oil with latex condoms. Oil-based lubricants can rapidly break down latex and allow the virus to pass through. Water-based lubricants include K-Y Jelly, Slippery stuff, ForPlay, Astroglide, ID Lubricants and most contraceptive jellies. These can be found in grocery or drug stores next to the condoms. 

WARNING: Some lubricants contain nonoxynol 9, which can cause irritation. This irritation may increase the risk of HIV transmission. Don`t use nonoxynol 9 or products containing it!

-The male condom should be put on after erection and before any sexual touch. Remember that pre-cum is also infected with HIV. The Reality condom should go in before sex - it can be inserted up to 8 hours before use. Never use the Reality and the male condoms together or two male condoms at the same time.

-Some male condoms have a reservoir tip; some don`t. In either case, the tip of the condom should be squeezed while rolling it down onto the penis in order to leave an airless pocket to collect semen. If the penis is natural and has a foreskin, try pulling back the foreskin before unrolling the condom all the way down to the base of the penis. Some men don`t like to pull back the foreskin because they`ve found that the condom slides off when the foreskin is pulled back. If you have trouble with this, consider keeping the foreskin down before putting on the condom or try using a Reality condom with your partner.

-After intercourse, withdraw the penis while still erect, holding the base of the condom to prevent it from slipping off or spilling semen. Remove the condom and wash the penis with soap and water. 

-Use a condom only once and dispose of it in the garbage; do not flush condoms down the toilet. Never reuse a condom.

-Use a condom EVERY TIME during sex when transmission or acquisition of HIV is possible. 
"
"Health";"STD";"What are the symptoms of a new HIV infection?";"Between 50-90% of people with new HIV infections have mild to severe \"flu-like\" symptoms 2 weeks to 3 months from the time of HIV exposure. Others do not have any symptoms. In general, symptoms are not a reliable way to tell if someone has been infected with HIV; the only way to know for sure is to get tested.  Many of the symptoms of early HIV infection are the same as for other, less serious illnesses. People who may have been exposed to HIV should see a doctor promptly if the following symptoms occur within 3 months of the exposure:
-A persistent fever of over 101 degrees that lasts more than 2 days without a known cause 
-Constant tiredness
-Night sweats that soak your pajamas or sheets
-A persistent rash of unknown cause
-Persistent swollen glands (lumps under the skin) which occur in several places at once (especially the neck, armpits and groin) 
-Sore throat
"
"Health";"STD";"Is there a cure for HIV and AIDS?";"Not at this time. Medical providers have become much better at identifying, monitoring, and treating HIV infection and AIDS. In 1995, a new class of drugs known as protease inhibitors became available. These new medications, used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs, have dramatically improved the health and quality of life for many people living with HIV/AIDS.
While there is not currently a cure or vaccine for HIV/AIDS, there are many things that people living with HIV/AIDS can do to remain healthy and to live longer. The first step for anyone who has HIV infection is to see a knowledgeable, experienced medical provider. This provider will be able to assess and monitor the infection, and, if appropriate, prescribe antiretroviral drugs.
People at increased risk for HIV infection need to be tested for HIV antibodies every 3-6 months. This way they can seek medical care at the earliest possible opportunity if they become infected with HIV. Early detection can also reduce the chance of HIV transmission when people are most infectious.
Although medical care and drugs are expensive, programs exist to ensure that people with HIV infection and AIDS can get the treatment and care they need.

"Health";"Tuberculosis (TB)";"There`s a blood test for TB?";"Yes. The FDA has approved blood tests that can be used in place of the tuberculin skin test. The blood test requires only one visit to have your blood drawn, instead of the two visits needed to have a skin test placed and then read 48-72 hours later. It will not give a false positive result if a person has ever received BCG. (BCG is a vaccine given in many countries with high rates of TB)."
"Health";"Tuberculosis (TB)";"What if my TB test is positive?";"You will need to have a chest x-ray. If your chest x-ray is normal, this means you have been infected with the TB bacteria but your immune system has \"walled off\" the bacteria and is protecting you from getting sick. Your doctor may recommend that you take medication to kill the bacteria so you will lower your risk of ever developing active TB disease.
If your chest x-ray is abnormal and/or you have symptoms of TB disease your doctor will order additional tests to see if you have active disease. Sputum (phlegm) samples will be collected to see if you are contagious. Persons with TB of the lungs or throat are usually contagious until they have taken TB medication for several weeks."
"Health";"Tuberculosis (TB)";"What if I had BCG vaccination for TB?";"<p>BCG is a vaccine for tuberculosis. It is often given to infants and young children in countries with high rates of tuberculosis. It protects children and babies from developing severe forms of tuberculosis , like meningitis or miliary TB. It is not used routinely in the United States. Your skin test <em style=\"font-weight: bold;\">may</em> be positive because of BCG vaccination.</p>
However, a positive skin test is most likely due to infection with TB bacteria if:
<UL>
    <LI>You recently spent time with a person who has active TB disease
    <LI>You are from an area of the world where active TB is very common (Africa, Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe and Russia)
    <LI>You spend time where TB disease is common (homeless shelters, migrant farm camps, drug treatment centers, health care clinics. jails or prisons)
    <LI>You were vaccinated more than 5-10 years ago
    <LI>Your skin test is greater than 20 mm </LI>
</UL>"
"Health";"Tuberculosis (TB)";"What is TB?";"Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by a bacteria called Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis). TB usually attack the lungs. Sometimes TB bacteria attack other parts of the body such as, the kidney, spine or brain. TB disease is a serious illness, but with proper treatment it can be cured."
"Health";"Tuberculosis (TB)";"What are the symptoms of TB disease?";"<P>Symptoms of TB disease can include any or all of the following:
<UL>
    <LI>Â A cough lasting longer than 3 weeks</LI>
    <LI>Trouble breathing</LI>
    <LI>Pain in the chest</LI>
    <LI>Feeling tired all of the time</LI>
    <LI>Fever</LI>
    <LI>Weight loss</LI>
    <LI>Poor appetite</LI>
    <LI>Night sweats</LI>
    <LI>Swollen lymph nodes</LI>
    <LI>Coughing up blood</LI>
</UL>
<P><STRONG>See your doctor if you have these symptoms.</STRONG></P>"
"Health";"Tuberculosis (TB)";"How is TB spread?";"When a person with active TB disease coughs or sneezes tiny droplets that contain TB bacteria are released into the air. If another person breathes air containing these droplets, they may become infected with the TB bacteria.
However, not everyone infected with TB bacteria becomes sick. As a result, two TB-related conditions exist: Latent TB infection (LTBI) and Active TB disease - both of which are treatable and curable."
"Health";"Tuberculosis (TB)";"What is the difference between latent TB infection and TB disease?";"A Person with Latent TB Infection
<ul>
<li>Usually has a skin test or a blood test result indicating TB infection*</li>
<li>Usually has a normal chest x-ray</li>
<li>Has TB bacteria in their body that are alive but inactive</li>
<li>Has no symptoms</li>
<li>Does not feel sick</li>
<li>Cannot spread TB to others</li>
<li>Should consider treatment for LTBI to stop active TB disease from spreading</li>
</ul>
A Person with Active TB Disease
<ul>
<li>Usually has a skin test or a blood test result indicating TB infection*</li>
<li>Usually has a normal chest x-ray</li>
<li>Has TB bacteria in their body</li>
<li>Usually feels sick and experiences symptoms</li>
<li>May spread TB to others</li>
<li>Needs treatment to cure the active TB disease</li>
</ul>
<span class=\"footnote\">*A positive tuberculin skin test (TST) or a positive blood test only shows that you have been infected with the TB bacteria. Neither test can tell if you have TB disease, only if the TB bacteria are in your body.</span>"
"Health";"Tuberculosis (TB)";"How is latent TB infection treated?";"A person with TB infection can take medication called Isoniazid or Rifampin. This will kill the TB bacteria and greatly reduce the risk of TB disease from developing. Your doctor will decide which medicine is best for you. It is important to have health monitoring every month while taking either of these medications to be sure that you are not developing any harmful side effects. Your health care provider may order blood tests during your treatment. "
"Health";"Tuberculosis (TB)";"How is TB disease treated?";"It takes a long time to kill all the TB bacteria.  A person with TB disease typically 	must take 4 different medicines for 2 months:
<ul>
<li>Isoniazid</li>
<li>Rifampin</li>
<li>Pyrazinamide</li>
<li>Ethambutol</li>
</ul>
Then take Isoniazid and Rifampin for another 4-7 months depending on how much damage the bacteria have caused. 

This treatment has been successful in treating TB disease for many years. In recent years, some TB bacteria strains have become resistant, (the medicines no longer kill the TB bacteria) to one or more of these drugs. 

Multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB is resistant to the two strongest TB medicines, Rifampin and Isoniazid. The most common cause of drug resistance occurs when TB medications are not taken long enough and/or in the right amounts. Drug resistant TB is much more difficult and expensive to successfully treat. One case of multi-drug resistant TB can cost more than $1 million to treat. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention urges all health care practitioners to use directly observed therapy (DOT) in the treatment of tuberculosis."
"Health";"Tuberculosis (TB)";"What is directly observed therapy (DOT)?";"To increase the success of TB disease treatment and decrease the risk of drug resistance, a health care worker observes each dose of TB medication taken.

Most persons believe they are able to take their medication without help. But 6 - 9 months is a long time to take antibiotics, especially after you start to feel better.  	Health care workers who provide DOT offer encouragement to complete 	treatment.  People are human and humans are sometimes forgetful.  DOT health 	care providers help people remember to take their medicine. They also check for 	harmful side effects and make sure the medicines are working as expected."
"Health";"Tuberculosis (TB)";"Who is most likely to get TB?";"Some people are more likely to be infected with the latent form of TB. These include:
<UL>
    <LI>persons who were born in a foreign country with high rates of TB</LI>
    <LI>persons who have lived in a foreign country with high rates of TB</LI>
    <LI>persons who have spent time with someone with active TB disease</LI>
    <LI>persons who live or spend a lot of time in crowded places</LI>
</UL>
Some people who are infected with latent TB have a greater risk of progressing to active TB disease. These include:
<UL>
    <LI>persons who became infected with TB in the last 2 years</LI>
    <LI>children under 5 years of age</LI>
    <LI>new immigrants from countries with high rates of TB - persons who have been in the United States for less than 5 years</LI>

"Health";"Vasectomy";"What is a vasectomy?";"A vasectomy is a sterilization operation for men. This means that after the operation a man cannot get a woman pregnant."
"Health";"Vasectomy";"Can a vasectomy be reversed if I change my mind afterwards?";"A vasectomy is a permanent operation. Some doctors try to undo a vasectomy with surgery, but it is expensive and many times does not work. Make sure that you do not want to father any more children before you have a vasectomy."
"Health";"Vasectomy";"Are there other ways to prevent pregnancy besides a vasectomy?";"Yes, there are several temporary ways to prevent pregnancy. A man can use a condom or a woman can use methods like birth control pills, the Depo shot, the patch, an IUD as well as others. If you would like more information about these and other temporary ways to prevent pregnancy, talk to your health care provider."
"Health";"Vasectomy";"How do they do a vasectomy?";"A vasectomy is done in a doctorâ€™s office or clinic. The doctor numbs the area and then makes a small cut in the scrotum (skin around the testicles) to get to the tubes that carry the sperm (sperm ducts). The doctor then closes off the sperm ducts so that sperm cannot get into the semen (what comes out during an orgasm). When there are no sperm in the semen, you cannot cause a pregnancy.

<img src=\"http://www.washoecounty.us/repository/images/4/vasectomy-illustration.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration showing the location of the sperm duct (tube), seminal vesicle (where sperm is stored), the closed off tube of a vasectomy, the testicle, and the scrotum.\" />"
"Health";"Vasectomy";"What are the benefits of a vasectomy?";"With a vasectomy you donâ€™t have to worry about making a woman pregnant and you donâ€™t have to use a temporary method of family planning again (like birth control pills for women, condoms to prevent pregnancy, etc). However, the procedure will not protect you against STDs. A condom is still the best method for STD prevention."
"Health";"Vasectomy";"What are the risks of a vasectomy?";"Vasectomy is a safe and simple operation, but there is a small chance you could have problems afterwards. Some of the problems include:
<ul>
<li>You may have temporary swelling around the area of the skin that was cut.</li>
<li>You may have bruising that usually goes away on its own.</li>
<li>You may get an infection on the skin or inside the scrotum.</li>
<li>The operation may not make you sterile. A small number of men who have the operation will still be able to get a woman pregnant. The vasectomy is more than 99% effective.</li>
</ul>"
"Health";"Vasectomy";"Will I still be able to have sex after a vasectomy?";"Yes. A vasectomy will not alter your sex drive. Your erections and orgasms will be the same. You will have the same amount of ejaculate (semen), but it will not contain sperm."

"Human Resources";"Examination FAQs";"What is an examination and why do I have to take one?
";"The term \"examination\" refers to the selection method used to rank all candidates for a particular classification. Applicants applying for employment with the Washoe County Merit System are required to go through an \"examination\" process. Depending upon the position for which you are applying, examinations may consist of written, oral, performance, physical agility tests, involve a rating of past experience and training, or be comprised of a combination of such tests."
"Human Resources";"Examination FAQs";"Are tests given for all positions?
";"The Department of Human Resources administers examinations to determine which applicants are the most qualified for a particular position.  There is no single test; examinations are developed to suit duties and responsibilities of each job classification.  The Department of Human Resources uses written and oral examinations, tests of physical ability, and demonstrations of practical skills as testing instruments.  For some positions, the entire examination consists of a rating of education and experience as you describe them in your application.

Some positions are unclassified and outside of the merit system.  Individuals selected for those positions serve at the pleasure of the hiring authority.  A variety of selection instruments may be used in evaluating candidates for these types of positions.
"
"Human Resources";"Examination FAQs";"What type of test might I expect?
";"The tentative examination content is described in Required Additional Information. Some jobs require a written test that may consist of short answer, multiple choice, true-false, or essay type questions that are directly related to the job. For example, do not be concerned about taking a spelling test if you are applying for a maintenance job; you will most likely be asked questions about plumbing, carpentry, painting, etc. 

Not all of Washoe County`s positions require written tests. Some jobs may require a performance test where applicants must perform tasks similar to those performed on the job. For example, clerical applicants may take a typing test. For certain jobs, such as a Sheriff`s Deputy, a physical ability test is also required. 

Another type of test is an oral exam, which reviews your qualifications,  experience, education and other knowledge, skills and abilities required for the job. This type of test is still structured and scored by a panel, but it does give you the opportunity to express yourself, and to discuss what unique qualifications you bring to the position. It also gives you the opportunity to ask questions about the job. 

The examination process may consist of one or any combination of these types of tests. You must successfully pass each portion of the examination in order to be considered. The passing score is determined by a statistical evaluation of the test scores. Applicants are notified of their test results by email. The Human Resources Department is always available to discuss any problems or questions you may have regarding the examination you have taken.

This index covers the period from mid-1962 through September 2007.  To search for obituary citations in that index, you will need to go to the catalog, select \"Browse\", enter the name of the deceased (last name, first name) into the search box, then click on \"subject\" to perform the search.  If the name is there, click on it to view the record.  You will need to click on the \"Catalog Record\" tab to view the details of the date and page the obituary appeared.  Please note, you are only viewing an index to help locate the obituary and will not be able to view the obituary itself.  Once you have the information, you can contact us for assistance retrieving the actual obituary.  Also please note, the index does not include obituaries from the <a href=\"http://www.dailysparkstribune.com\">Sparks Tribune</a>.

For obituaries appearing from 2003 to present, full-text is available online, with your Washoe County Library card, in the Proquest database for the <a href=\"http://search.proquest.com/renogazettejournal?accountid=63227\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Proquest\">Reno Gazette Journal</a>.You can usually find it by simply typing the name of the deceased into the search box.  If the name is very common, you may want to limit by date if you know approximately when the obituary would have appeared in the newspaper, to avoid getting a lot of incorrect results.

Outside of the library's resources, you can find very recent obituaries through the Reno Gazette-Journal website at <a href=\"http://www.rgj.com\">RGJ.com</a> by clicking on \"Obituaries\" (this is provided through Legacy.com, a national obituary listing website).  The RGJ also has a limited (2002-2008) archive of obituaries formerly appearing on their site at http://acorn.rgj.com/obits/archive/ in full text.

If you require assistance using any of these resources or need us to retrieve an obituary, please contact us using our <a href=\"/library/ask.html\">ask a librarian</a> page.

"Manager`s Office";"Truckee Meadows Fire Transition Plan ";"Who are the Truckee Meadows Board of Fire Commissioners (BOFC)?";"The Washoe County Commissioners serve as the Fire Commissioners: John Breternitz, David Humke, Kitty Jung, Robert Larkin and Bonnie Weber."
"Manager`s Office";"Truckee Meadows Fire Transition Plan ";"When and why did the BOFC terminate the Interlocal Agreement for Fire Services (also known as, the Fire Services Agreement) with the Reno Fire Department?";"On June 28, 2011 the BOFC elected to terminate the Fire Services Agreement, following many months of discussion and two formal requests to the City of Reno to address issues of concern.  The termination was based  primarily on an independently verified financial analysis that showed  that the District was not financially sustainable given the current expenditure levels and on-going property tax revenue reductions in that fire districtâ€™s service territory.  

In short, if urgent action was not taken, the District would continue to suffer declining fund balances, and could be in a deficit in as little as two years. In making the decision, the BOFC noted the decision to terminate the agreement with the Reno Fire Department (RFD) was made based on the financial analysis presented to them; noting that while the District has saved approximately $11 million over the past decade as a result of the interlocal agreement between Truckee Meadows Fire Protection District (TMFPD) and RFD, current economic conditions make the current and proposed agreement financially unsustainable and could lead to the fire districtâ€™s financial demise."
"Manager`s Office";"Truckee Meadows Fire Transition Plan ";"What are the next steps and will my services be impacted?";"A Transition Plan has been created that will transfer direct operational responsibility to TMFPD.  The plan is available for review at http://www.washoecounty.us/repository/files/1/tmfpd_transition_plan_aug2011.pdf

Restarting direct delivery of service will not be a simple task. Much work is required to ensure the seamless transition of service between the entities. The primary focus of this effort must be to effectively manage the transition, so that there is no interruption of service to the community, which is the Boardâ€™s primary commitment to the residents of TMFPD.

This Transition Plan describes in detail the actions that are necessary to accomplish the transfer of operational responsibility. The plan is divided into nine functional areas:

Organization 
Capital Assets and Equipment 
Human Resources 
Finance 
Risk Management 
Legal 
Technology 
External Relationships 
Volunteer Fire Departments 

The BOFC has indicated that their long-term goal is regionalization of fire services, and they would initially pursue the merger of the Sierra Fire Protection District and the Truckee Meadows Fire Protection District, since both Districts will be under their authority effective July 2012. The analysis of the feasibility of that integration will be completed and provided to the BOFC no later than November of 2011."
"Manager`s Office";"Truckee Meadows Fire Transition Plan ";"What is the plan for areas of Truckee Meadows that we have heard are not served as quickly by TMFPD as they can be by RFD?";"Staff is currently working with Reno to fully identify the areas within the City and the District where a fair exchange of automatic aid from the closest fire station would be in the best interest of service to the citizens. "
"Manager`s Office";"Truckee Meadows Fire Transition Plan ";"Will the boundaries of the District change? ";"There are no plans to change the district boundaries; however, the BOFC has directed staff to pursue opportunities for regionalization, which might ultimately involve boundary changes.  As with tax rates, any changes to District boundaries would be fully discussed in open public meetings before any decisions could be made."
"Manager`s Office";"Truckee Meadows Fire Transition Plan ";"How can the TMFPD operate less expensively than the City of Reno?  Arenâ€™t smaller fire departments more costly than larger ones?";"The City of Renoâ€™s labor agreement with their union mandates a minimum of 4-person staffing on each fire engine. The ability for the TMFPD to operate with flexible staffing is extremely important in meeting the District's two primary goals of keeping fire stations open and operating and eliminating the District's budget deficit. Line personnel costs amount to roughly $100,000 annually per person on average.  

With minimum 3-person staffing, a savings of 15 personnel or $1.5 million per year could be achieved, thereby allowing all 5 stations to remain open and operating while eliminating the District's operating deficit.  It is possible that with flexible staffing, there could be 4-person staffing when required."
"Manager`s Office";"Truckee Meadows Fire Transition Plan ";"What about Emergency Medical Services (EMS)?  Will TMFPD provide EMS like the Sierra District does? ";"TMFPD has in the past and will continue to staff their engines with Emergency Medical Technicians certified at the Intermediate level. While this level is not the same as the Paramedic staffing in SFPD, they can administer intravenous fluids and medications consistent with their certification. REMSA will continue to provide EMS service in its primary response zones as specified in its franchise agreement."
"Manager`s Office";"Truckee Meadows Fire Transition Plan ";"Will my taxes change?  ";"The budget for the re-organized District is balanced and sustainable without a tax increase, so there is no plan to change tax rates in the Truckee Meadows Fire Protection District in the foreseeable future. As the Commission evaluates regionalizing fire service, however, any changes to tax rates that might be proposed (decreasing or increasing) would be thoroughly discussed with citizens in open public meetings before any decisions would be made by the District Board."

"Manager`s Office";"Truckee Meadows Fire Transition Plan ";"If equipment/apparatus has been replaced over the past eleven years, how will Truckee Meadows know which is theirs? Is there a bar code system used?";"Yes, the District utilizes bar code system and in addition all apparatus and equipment is tracked via purchase order and the Countyâ€™s asset tracking protocols. "
"Manager`s Office";"Truckee Meadows Fire Transition Plan ";"Will bio-mass sites still operate?";"The seasonal Bio Mass collection sites are funded by a three year ARRA grant. The grant has capacity for one more season and staff will be researching alterative means to keep this program operating."
"Manager`s Office";"Truckee Meadows Fire Transition Plan ";"Will there be a new Fire Board?";"There is no need for a new Fire Board as the elected Truckee Meadows Board of Fire Commissioners currently is in place and has been since the district was formed in 1974."
"Manager`s Office";"Truckee Meadows Fire Transition Plan ";"Please explain what are automatic and mutual aid agreements.";"Automatic aid agreements are typically entered into between neighboring agencies resulting in the closest resource being dispatched regardless of jurisdiction. In addition these agreements result in enhancements in depth and availability of effective response to those calls that require additional staffing and apparatus. 

Mutual Aid is a voluntary response by agencies and is based on the needs of the agency in command of the incident. Mutual Aid is typically requested when an incident exceeds the capabilities of the local agency. Mutual Aid requests can be made of local, state, federal and out of state agencies. 
"
"Manager`s Office";"Truckee Meadows Fire Transition Plan ";"Please explain how dispatch determines what and how many units are sent to an incident? When, how and who â€œcalls offs/cancelsâ€ additional units?";"Each agency determines the pre identified resources that will be dispatched to the various types of emergency calls.  The predetermined resources based on location are then programmed into the Computer Aided Dispatch system which then automatically identifies what is sent to emergences at specific addresses and or locations.

The first arriving unit and or Chief Officer will make a determination as to if they need the responding resources to continue, can handle the incident with the resources responding or need additional resources.
"
"Manager`s Office";"Truckee Meadows Fire Transition Plan ";"Will TMFPD and Sierra Fire become one district?";"The TMFPD approved transition plan contains a task that requires staff to identify the benefits and costs of joining the two districts into one service delivery program.  The results of this task must be presented to the BOFC no later then December of 2011.  The Board will decide based on all available information whether that is in the long-term best interests of the residents of both districts."

An event held inside a Washoe County Parks building facility may have amplified music indoors."
"Parks - Regional Parks and Open Space";"Parks";"Can I stay in a Washoe County park after the posted closing time?";"Normally, park users must be out of the park by closing times posted at the facility. However, if you have reserved a building past normal closing hours, the time you must leave will be on your Facility Use Permit. You may also walk at Rancho San Rafael two hours before opening and two hours past closing time. Your vehicle must be parked outside the gate."

Please check with your school to see which agency operates your designated site and contact that agency to register your child."
"Public Defender";"Attorney Assignment";"How can I get the services of a Public Defender?";"In order to qualify for the services of the Washoe County Public Defender`s Office, you have to be considered \"indigent\".  Indigency is generally defined as not having enough resources to hire private counsel. That decision is made by Court Services and the judge presiding over the case and is based upon your current financial circumstances, including an examination of a person`s financial assets and liabilities.  Most people, even if they qualify as indigent, are asked to make some financial contribution to the County for the services of the Public Defender, normally between $250 and $1000."
"Public Defender";"Attorney Assignment";"How do I find out the name of my Public Defender?";"If the court appoints the Public Defender`s Office, you will receive a letter from us.  The letter will tell you the name of the attorney who will be assisting you.  You may also call our Front Desk at 775-337-4800 to find out this information."
"Public Defender";"Attorney Assignment";"I have been told that I have a `Conflict Attorney`, what does that mean?";"Public Defenders are licensed attorneys.  As such, they are bound by the same rules of ethics, including the rule that you may not represent someone when a conflict of interest arises.  Conflicts of interest normally arise when the Washoe County Public Defender`s Office has previously represented a witness in a new case.

In order to accommodate this situation, Washoe County has created the Alternate Public Defender`s Office.  Washoe County also has contracted with an outside group of private attorneys in case of conflicts within the APD office.  Every case that comes into the Public Defender`s Office is immediately screened for conflicts of interest.  Whenever such a conflict is detected, the case file is transferred to the Alternate Public Defender`s Office."
"Public Defender";"Attorney Assignment";"How can I contact a conflict attorney?";"The Conflict Attorney Group is administered by the Washoe County Alternate Public Defenders Office.  Their office phone number is 775-328-3955."
"Public Defender";"Criminal Issues";"If I am arrested for drug possession, is there a way to have my criminal case dismissed?";"Yes. Certain drug offenses, excluding Trafficking, may allow you to qualify for Diversion. Diversion places you under the supervision of the State and Court, but allows you, after successful completion of the supervision, to move to have the charges dismissed and the record of the offense sealed.  There are different programs available under Nevada law and you should discuss whether you are eligible, and which program might be best for you, with your attorney."
"Public Defender";"Criminal Issues";"If I am arrested, should I talk to the police?";"If you are arrested, the police will have to let you know that you have a right to an attorney before any questioning begins. If you are given the right to an attorney, it is probably for a good reason. Exercise and invoke your rights. If you want to talk to the police, do so AFTER you speak to an attorney. They will understand."
"Public Defender";"Criminal Issues";"If the police don`t read me my rights, can I get my case dismissed?";"Not necessarily.  The Miranda warning provides notice of the right against self-incrimination and protects a person from having their statements used against them if the statements are the product of a custodial interrogation.

If a court were to rule that such statements were inadmissible in court, that ruling would obviously have some impact on how the case would be resolved. Ultimately, the State would have to pursue the charge based upon other evidence.  Unfortunately, the State may have `other evidence` independent of the inadmissible statement.  If you have concerns about statements given to the police, please discuss the events with your attorney."
"Public Defender";"Criminal Issues";"How can I find out what courtroom my case is in?";"The location and time of your hearing should be on the letter you received from the Public Defender`s Office.  If you don`t have that information, please contact our office at 775-337-4800. Also, this website has a Case Tracking page that will allow you to access information regarding the time and place for all District Court hearings. Go to <a href=\"http://www.washoecourts.com\">www.washoecourts.com</a>."
"Public Defender";"Criminal Issues";"What is an arraignment?";"An arraignment is a hearing where an initial plea is entered to an offense.  Normally, a person who is arrested and brought to the jail will have an arraignment conducted by video within 48 hours of their arrest.  If a `not guilty` plea is entered, the court will normally ask the accused if they can afford private counsel. If the offense qualifies for the appointment for the services of the Public Defender`s Office, an application can be made."
"Public Defender";"Criminal Issues";"What is a preliminary hearing?";"A preliminary hearing is where the State must prove to a neutral magistrate that there is `probable cause` to believe that a crime has been committed, and that there is `probable cause` to believe that the accused committed the offense. This burden of proof must be met for the case to continue into District Court.  The burden of proof, `probable cause`, is lower than required at a trial.  At trial, the State has the burden of proving every element of the offense \"beyond a reasonable doubt\"."
"Public Defender";"Criminal Issues";"What if I fail to appear?";"Failing to appear for a scheduled court appearance is a separate criminal offense and can be the basis for the issuance of a warrant.  Failing to appear in court can also lead to the revocation of any bail or own recognizance release.  If you fail to appear in court, you should contact your attorney immediately to see what actions can be taken on your behalf."
"Public Defender";"Criminal Issues";"What do I do if I know I have a warrant?";"Please contact your attorney. Do not hide this information from your attorney. This is important information for counsel to consider when forming a plan to challenge the State`s case."
"Public Defender";"Criminal Issues";"What do I do if I am picked up on a warrant?";"If you are arrested on a warrant, you should follow the advice given to any person that is arrested; ask to talk to an attorney. If you are arrested on a warrant for an offense that involves a case where a Public Defender was appointed, please call our office at 775-337-4800."
"Public Defender";"Criminal Issues";"What can I expect if I am arrested?";"Obviously an arrest involves a tremendous loss of liberty.  You will be photographed, fingerprinted, and asked to change into jail issue clothes.  You should be allowed to make a phone call. Normally, you will be interviewed in order to gather information that will help the detention center determine the best way to house you safely.  If you are taking medication or have other issues that might effect your placement at the jail, please notify jail staff or ask your family and friends to contact the detention center.  If you have been appointed a Public Defender, you should also advise them of any issues that might effect your classification at the detention center."
"Public Defender";"Criminal Issues";"What is probation and what happens if I violate it?";"Probation is a privilege and not a right.  Probation is an opportunity to prove that you do not need to be incarcerated. When a person is placed on probation, the court normally enters a jail or prison sentence, but suspends the imposition of the sentence, provided that the defendant complies with certain requirements, such as reporting to a probation officer, not being arrested or convicted of new offenses while on probation, pay restitution, attending counseling or other conditions set out by the court.

If the court finds that a person violated probation, it means that they have not complied with the conditions set out by the court.  The court can then impose the previously suspended sentence and place the defendant in jail or prison. It is very important to let your Public Defender know if the reason you were unable to comply was due to financial, substance abuse, or other issues, so that the court can consider the information and, hopefully, reinstate the term of probation."
"Public Defender";"Criminal Issues";"What is bail?";"Bail is a security, usually money or property, given to ensure that if an accused person is released from custody, they will still attend future court appearances."
"Public Defender";"General";"How do I go about getting my records `sealed`?";"The Law Library has information regarding sealing records. You can visit their website at <a href=\"http://www.co.washoe.nv.us/lawlib\">www.co.washoe.nv.us/lawlib</a>."
"Public Defender";"General";"Are Public Defenders attorneys?";"Yes. This is perhaps the most common misconception of the public.  All Public Defenders have obtained a College degree and graduated from an accredited Law School. All Public Defenders have passed the Nevada Bar Exam and many are licensed to practice in both state and federal courts."
"Public Defender";"General";"What is the difference between a Public Defender and a District Attorney?";"The District Attorney is an elected official.  The District Attorney is charged with the enforcement of laws in Washoe County and employs Deputy District Attorneys to assist in that effort.

The Washoe County Public Defender is appointed by the Board of County Commissioners.  Every community must provide and fund attorneys for indigent persons facing a loss of liberty.

While both offices are funded by the government, both offices serve independent functions."
"Public Defender";"General";"Can I file my own motions in court?";"If you are represented by an attorney, all motions and pleadings must be endorsed by your attorney. Motions and pleadings that are sent without the endorsement of the assigned attorney are generally considered fugitive documents and not considered by the court. A person should be very careful when they send documents to the court, as it is likely that the State prosecutor will be able to gain access to all documents in the court`s file and potentially use them against the accused."

"Public Defender";"General";"Do Public Defenders have the same obligations as private attorneys?";"Yes and No.  Public Defenders are licensed attorneys and have almost all of the same obligations of private attorneys. Because the services of the Public Defender are offered only in certain circumstances, Public Defenders do not maintain private trust accounts for legal fees and are exempt from certain other requirements regarding the safe-keeping of client assets. Otherwise, Public Defenders must act and perform in the same manner as private attorneys. "
"Public Defender";"General";"Can the Public Defender`s Office represent me on my traffic ticket?";"Remember, the Public Defender only represents persons facing a loss of liberty.

"Public Works";"Roads/Streets";"Wonâ€™t a â€˜CHILDREN AT PLAYâ€™ sign help protect our children?";"	At first consideration, it might seem that this sign would provide protection for youngsters playing in the neighborhood.  It doesnâ€™t.
	Studies made in cities where such signs were widely posted in residential areas show no evidence of having reduced pedestrian crashes, vehicle speed or legal liability.  In fact, many types of signs which were installed to warn of normal conditions in residential areas failed to achieve the desired safety benefits.  Further, if signs encourage parents with children to believe they have an added degree of protection, which the signs do not and cannot provide, a great disservice results.  
	Obviously, children should not be encouraged to play in the roadway.  The â€˜CHILDREN AT PLAYâ€™ sign is a direct and open suggestion that it is acceptable to do so.  Federal standards discourage the use of â€˜CHILDREN AT PLAYâ€™ signs.  Specific warnings for schools, playgrounds, parks and other recreational facilities are available for use where clearly justified.  
"
"Public Works";"Roads/Streets";"What is the harm of installing an unwarranted traffic sign?";"Traffic control devices which include signs, such as stop signs, speed limit signs, animal crossing warning signs and curve warning signs as well as signals and pavement markings, are installed to regulate traffic flow and improve safety.  The installation of these traffic control devices should be based on National guidelines; the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices, (MUTCD) gives Traffic Engineers the uniform standards to safely assist motorists as they travel.  It defines a series of uniform traffic control devices (signals, signs and pavement markings) which are clear in their messages as applied on the nationâ€™s roadway system.  
	To ensure that the motoring public maintains a healthy respect for traffic control devices, traffic engineers must use them prudently and thereby maximize the safety and efficiency of our streets and highways.  It is important to apply traffic control devices consistently, maintaining uniformity in size, shape, color and location so that they command respect and deliver a clear message

"Public Works";"Roads/Streets";"What is Washoe County`s policy regarding gates within a public roadway?";"1. If the easement is a private road (i.e. privately maintained, private access) then gating and locking is a private issue and is no concern of Washoe County, except if a road is a presumed public access under NRS 405.191 and NRS 405.195 and further deemed to be by the Washoe County Board of Commissioners. 

2. If the access is created on a map and is a privately maintained public access, then no gates will be allowed provided the map was approved with the access and without gating.

3. If the road is presumed public access (as determined by the Washoe County Board of Commissioner) under NRS 405.191 and NRS 405.195, access can be gated but not locked and must have a sign posted stating â€œPublic Access.â€

4. Access issues concerning access on private property and identified as public access are not considered to be a County issue and should be treated as a civil matter.

5. If a road easement does not specify it is a private road easement, then it is presumed to be public access, both privately owned and privately maintained.

"
"Public Works";"Roads/Streets";"Can I put a gate across a roadway?";"1. If the roadway is on your private property with no easement: Yes

2. If the roadway is on a private access easement: Yes, with the permission of everyone that has rights to the easement.

"Public Works";"Roads/Streets";"Wonâ€™t a â€˜Stop Signâ€™ slow traffic on our street?";"Stop signs installed in the wrong places for the wrong purposes usually create more problems than they solve.  One common misuse of stop signs is to arbitrarily interrupt traffic by causing it to stop with the idea that traffic speeds will be slowed down.  Studies made in many parts of the country show that there is a high incidence of intentional violations where stop signs are installed as â€œspeed breakersâ€.  These studies showed that speed was reduced in the vicinity of the stop sign, but speeds were actually higher between intersections than they would have been if these signs hadnâ€™t been installed.  
At the right place and under the right conditions, a stop sign tells drivers and pedestrians who has the right of way.  Nationally recognized standards have been established to determine when stop signs should be used.  These standards, or â€˜warrantsâ€™ take into consideration traffic speed, volume, sight distance and the frequency of traffic â€œgapsâ€ which will allow safe vehicle entry or pedestrian crossing.  
	Most drivers are reasonable and prudent, but when confronted with unreasonable restrictions, they frequently violate them and develop a general contempt for all traffic controls

The roadways were set apart on the map but they were not improved, they were not dedicated to, nor were they ever accepted by Washoe County. The law at the time was 5063.23 (which later became NRS 278.380). The statutes stated that the Board of County Commissioners â€œaccept or reject any and all offers of dedicationâ€. Since there was no offer of dedication made when the map was recorded and there has not been a subsequent offer of dedication, the County does not have ownership of the roadway. Since the County does not own the road, the County has no duty to maintain it. Sky Tavern Road has also been thoroughly reviewed by Washoe County and it has been determined that the roadway does not meet Washoe County street standards. Sky Tavern Road appears to be a â€œpublic accessâ€ road that is privately owned and maintained in accordance with NRS 405.191. The roadways maintained in this area are portions of the Old Mt. Rose Hwy that were relinquished to Washoe County from the State of Nevada, Department of Highways January 20, 1961.

If you plead \"guilty\" or \"no contest\" to the misdemeanor charges (except if the charge is either DUI or Domestic Battery) you will be sentenced during the arraignment. Because the penalties are more severe if the charge is either a DUI or Domestic Battery a Deputy District Attorney must also be present and an alcohol evaluation may be required before sentencing.  For these reasons, sentencing may be continued to another date. If you plead \"not guilty\" a trial date is set within SIXTY (60) days of the arraignment date.

A criminal complaint MAY or MAY NOT be issued thereafter."
"Reno Justice Court";"Evictions - Landlord";"Where do I get the form for an eviction notice for nonpayment of rent?  ";"You can obtain an eviction notice for nonpayment of rent from the Court if you are using it for property that is located in Reno Township. Reno Township includes all of Washoe County except for Sparks, Sun Valley, Palomino Valley, Wadsworth, Gerlach, Incline Village and Verdi.  You may also obtain eviction information and forms from the Nevada Supreme Court website <a href=\"http://nvsupremecourt.us/documents/\" target=_blank>http://nvsupremecourt.us/documents/</a>"
"Reno Justice Court";"Evictions - Landlord";"Can I serve an eviction notice myself?  ";"Yes, but you must personally serve the eviction notice on a party at the tenant`s residence and you must bring a witness with you."
"Reno Justice Court";"Evictions - Landlord";"Can a family member, such as my spouse, be the witness?  ";"Yes."
"Reno Justice Court";"Evictions - Landlord";"Do I have to have my signature notarized on the service paper?  ";"No. The clerks in the Civil Division can witness your signature and sign instead of having your signature notarized."
"Reno Justice Court";"Evictions - Landlord";"Can I reproduce the eviction forms at home or prepare them on my computer?  ";"Yes, as long as the language is exactly the same on your reproduction as it is on the court forms."
"Reno Justice Court";"Evictions - Landlord";"If I have a process server file and serve my eviction, can that person come to the court hearing if there is one?  

";"Yes, but they cannot represent you on your case.  Only someone who can represent your case and sign as the landlord/agent on the affidavit of landlord can appear at the hearing on an eviction; e.g., a property manager."
"Reno Justice Court";"Evictions - Landlord";"Can I post and mail my eviction by Certificate of Mailing?  ";"Yes.  The judges request that landlords mail the eviction by \"Certificate of Mailing\".  This requires filling out a very small form at the Post Office. The fee for a Certificate of Mailing is minimal compared to Certified Mail."
"Reno Justice Court";"Evictions - Landlord";"How do I get a lockout order?  ";"Refer to the instructions on the type of eviction you have served to see if you qualify to have a lockout order issued. If you do, come to the Court with all the correct paperwork. The clerk will make sure the tenant has not filed an affidavit of tenant and will issue the lockout order. There is a fee of $55.00. You will receive a copy of your file-stamped affidavit of landlord, take it to the Washoe County Sheriff`s Office Civil Division Substation, located at 195 South Sierra (on the corner of Sierra and Court) OR the Washoe County Sheriff`s Office Civil Division, located at 911 Parr Boulevard and pay the fee to serve the lockout order. If you have any questions, call the Court at (775-325-6501)."
"Reno Justice Court";"Evictions - Landlord";"What if the tenant leaves personal property after vacating?  ";"You are responsible for safeguarding a tenant`s personal property for (not to exceed) THIRTY (30) days.  During that period, it would be to your advantage to allow the tenant to remove the property if you can make arrangements to do so in a reasonable amount of time. If the tenant cannot be reached, you must mail a certified letter to his last known address and inform him that he has (THIRTY) 30 days from the day after he was locked out to pick up his property or it will be disposed of after that date.  The tenant may also be charged the costs you incur in inventorying, moving and storing his property.   If those costs are not paid, you DO NOT have to release his property.  However, YOU CANNOT HOLD A TENANT`S PROPERTY IF HE FAILS TO PAY THE RENT. The rent debt after the lockout is a separate action which can be pursued through Small Claims."
"Reno Justice Court";"Evictions - Landlord";"Do I have a judgment when an eviction results in a lockout order?  ";"No. A lockout order is simply an eviction procedure. It is not a judgment. You cannot start attaching wages by simply getting a lockout order. If you want to pursue collection of the rent, you must file a  separate action, go to Court and be awarded a judgment before you may start attaching wages."
"Reno Justice Court";"Evictions - Landlord";"Does it really only take 30 days to get someone evicted on a 30 day notice?  ";"No.  If the tenant does not move within the THIRTY (30) days of receiving a 30/7 day no cause notice, you must obtain an unlawful detainer eviction notice. The waiting period for the court date on the unlawful detainer is approximately 10 days after you file the notice."
"Reno Justice Court";"Evictions - Landlord";"What if the tenant wants to pay the rent after I have had a lockout order issued?   ";"You do not have to accept the rent after a lockout order has been issued.  If you accept the tenant`s rent, call the Washoe County Sheriff and verbally cancel the eviction.  Contact the Sheriff at (775) 328-6544 to find out if you qualify to receive a refund. The Court cannot refund your $6.00 lockout fee after the lockout order was issued."
"Reno Justice Court";"Evictions - Tenant";"How do I contest an eviction?  ";"If you have received an eviction notice for nonpayment of rent, come to the Court within the time period stated on the eviction notice to file an affidavit of tenant. The filing fee is $33.00 CASH ONLY.  If you cannot afford to pay the fee, there are In Forma Pauperis forms available to fill out and submit to the judge. The judge will either grant or deny the motion to proceed In Forma Pauperis."
"Reno Justice Court";"Evictions - Tenant";"What do I do if I`ve been served with a lockout order but never got served with the eviction notice?  ";"You can file a pleading called a \"motion to stay or vacate eviction order\". This motion is submitted to the judge.  If the judge grants the stay, the landlord may be required to let you back in and a hearing would be set. If the judge denies the motion you will not be allowed back into the unit."
"Reno Justice Court";"Evictions - Tenant";"What if I don`t agree with the judge or the landlord about the results of the eviction hearing and I think what happened is unfair?  ";"You can file an appeal. Contact either Washoe Legal Services at (775) 329-2727 or hire an attorney to file a Notice of Appeal.  (See Eviction Costs)."
"Reno Justice Court";"Evictions - Tenant";"What if I file bankruptcy? Will it stop the eviction process?  ";"This depends upon the type of bankruptcy filed. Contact the Bankruptcy Court at (775) 784-5559 between 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. to find out precisely what is required to stop the eviction.  You should also notify your attorney that you are being evicted."
"Reno Justice Court";"Evictions - Tenant";"Can I be served with more than one eviction notice?  ";"Yes.  It is possible to be served with a 30 day no cause notice AND a non payment of rent notice OR ALL of our eviction notices at the same time.  If that happens, each notice MUST be dealt with separately.  If one eviction is denied by the Court, IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT ALL EVICTIONS ARE DENIED BY THE COURT."
"Reno Justice Court";"Justice of the Peace";"Is it possible to speak privately with the judge about my case?   ";"No.  The judge can only speak with you about your case if all parties are present.  To speak with the judge, you or your attorney must make a request in writing to the judge to do so.  You must also provide a copy of your written request to all other parties or their attorneys.  When you submit your request, you must specify your case number so that the clerk can place your request in the Court`s file and provide the file to the judge for review."
"Reno Justice Court";"Justice of the Peace";"Who determines which Justice of the Peace will hear my case?  ";"All cases are randomly assigned by a computer program."
"Reno Justice Court";"Justice of the Peace";"I have filed several cases in the Civil Department and I would like to have the same judge hear all of them at the same time.  Is that possible? ";" No.  All cases are randomly assigned by a computer program."
"Reno Justice Court";"Justice of the Peace";"Why did the judge to whom my case was assigned recuse himself/herself?  

";"Sometimes, to avoid the appearance of bias or prejudice, because of personal knowledge of a case or party, or for other such reasons, the judge may request reassignment of a case to another Justice of the Peace for hearing."
"Reno Justice Court";"Justice of the Peace";"I have a legal question regarding my case.  Can the judge give me legal advice on my case?  ";"No.  The judge must remain \"fair and impartial\" and cannot give you legal advice on your case.  If you need legal advice you should contact an attorney or a legal service."
"Reno Justice Court";"Justice of the Peace";"I want my marriage ceremony to be performed by a Justice of the Peace.  Is that possible?  ";"Yes.  A Justice of the Peace may perform marriages.  However, by law there is a limit to the number of marriages a Justice of the Peace can perform each year.  Washoe County also has a Commissioner of Civil Marriages.  There is no limit to the number of marriages that the Commissioner may perform each year.  The office of the Commissioner of Civil Marriages is located at 350 South Center Street, Suite 100
Reno, NV 89520 and the telephone number is (775) 337-4575.  

Marriage Licenses can be obtained at the Washoe County Clerk`s Office located at 75 Court Street, Reno, NV 89501, Room 131. http://www.co.washoe.nv.us/clerks/locations.php"
"Reno Justice Court";"Justice of the Peace";"How much will I have to pay if I plead guilty or I am found guilty of a misdemeanor offense in Reno Justice Court?  ";"Normally the amount of the fine imposed by the judge is the amount indicated as bail in the criminal complaint.  If the complaint is a citation, the bail is indicated at the bottom of the citation.  If the complaint is other than a citation, the bail is indicated on the last page at the end of the complaint.  HOWEVER, the fine imposed by the judge may be less or more than the amount indicated in the criminal complaint.  The judge may impose a fine of up to $1,000.00 for EACH offense described in the complaint.  The judge may also sentence you to up to SIX (6) MONTHS in the Washoe County Detention Facility for EACH offense described in the complaint, although that does not occur in the normal case."
"Reno Justice Court";"Small Claims";"Do I have to answer the Small Claims Affidavit and Order?  ";"No, you can just appear in court on the scheduled date and time."
"Reno Justice Court";"Small Claims";"What if I want to file a claim against the plaintiff or a third-party?  

";"If you wish to file a claim against the plaintiff (counter-claim) or a claim against a third party (cross-claim) in the case in which you are named as a defendant you must follow the same procedure that a plaintiff must follow for filing a claim."
"Reno Justice Court";"Small Claims";"I know I owe the money.  Can I just pay the plaintiff?  ";"Yes, you can meet the plaintiff at Reno Justice Court or any other location on or before the court date and do so."
"Reno Justice Court";"Small Claims";"I know I owe the money, but I can`t pay it all at one time.  What can I do? 

";" You can contact the plaintiff and sign a form called a \"Stipulation\", which will indicate how much principal you owe plus court costs and what your weekly/monthly payments would be and when. Most collection agencies have this form in their office and will fill it out while you are there. Both you and the plaintiff must sign the stipulation.   Afterward, the plaintiff may bring the stipulation to the Court for the judge to sign. As long as you adhere to the terms of the stipulation, the plaintiff will not attempt to collect on the full amount of the judgment.   If you do not adhere to the terms of the stipulation, the plaintiff may do whatever is necessary to collect on the full amount of the judgment."
"Reno Justice Court";"Small Claims";"What if I have paperwork to show to the judge to defend or prove my case?  ";"You need to bring the originals and two copies of all documents (one for you and one for the plaintiff) to court. The originals remain with the Court."
"Reno Justice Court";"Small Claims";"If the plaintiff has sued the wrong person and another person is involved, what should I do?  

";"If you are simply the wrong person, with perhaps the same name as the defendant, you should write a letter to the judge who is assigned to hear your case and explain the situation.  The judge will decide what should be done. You should also send a copy of the letter to the plaintiff. If you think another person is responsible for the debt, you may file a cross-claim to bring that person to Court as a third-party in the Small Claim case. The filing fee for a cross-claim is $33.00 and the third-party must be served at least 10 days before the hearing."
"Reno Justice Court";"Small Claims";"What if I don`t agree with the judge`s decision in my Small Claims case?  ";"You can file an appeal. Appeal fees total $525.00. (See Small Claims Costs) If the judgment is against you and you are appealing, you may also want to file a Supersedeas Bond for the total of the judgment including court costs so the other side cannot attempt to collect the judgment while the appeal process is taking place."
"Reno Justice Court";"Small Claims";"What should I do if I want to sue somebody for more than $5,000.00 (more than the Small Claims limit)?  

";"The Small Claims limit is $5,000.00. If you want to sue for more than that amount, you need to file your claim as a Civil Action. You may consult an attorney to file a Summons and Complaint for you or you may reduce the amount to $5,000.00 and do it yourself in Small Claims. The Court does not have forms for filing Complaints."
"Reno Justice Court";"Small Claims";"What happens if the defendant files for bankruptcy before we go to Court?  ";"You should contact the Bankruptcy Court to find out exactly what kind of bankruptcy the defendant is filing and what it means to your Small Claims case. The phone number for Bankruptcy Court in Reno is (775) 784-5559 from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Monday through Friday."
"Reno Justice Court";"Small Claims";"Can I start attaching the defendant`s wages in Reno if I have a Small Claims judgment from a different state?  ";"No. You must either re-file the Small Claim and use your foreign judgment as an exhibit to the Small Claim and obtain another judgment from our court or you can file the foreign judgment in the Second Judicial District Court. You should contact the Second Judicial District Court for instructions at (775) 328-3110."
"Reno Justice Court";"Small Claims";"What do I do if I filed my Small Claim in the wrong court?  

";"You can request a transfer to another court. For example, if it should have been filed in Sparks Justice Court, you can either write a letter to the judge assigned to your case requesting a transfer or you can file a Motion for Transfer and submit a proposed Order for Transfer. Reno Justice Court does not have forms for either the Motion for Transfer or the Order for Transfer."
"Reno Justice Court";"Small Claims";"How do I get a judgment removed from my credit report?  

";"You can call the Court at (775) 325-6501 and ask whether or not a Satisfaction of Judgment was filed or not. If a Satisfaction of Judgment was not filed, you must pay the plaintiff in full and they will be required to file a Satisfaction of Judgment. Once the Satisfaction of Judgment is filed, you may request a certified copy of it from the Court and mail it to the credit bureau as proof of payment."
"Reno Justice Court";"Small Claims";"How do I collect on my judgment?  

";"There are several options to collecting on a judgment: 1)You can have an execution issued to attach wages, a cash drawer, a bank account or vehicle; 2) You can obtain an Order for Supplementary Proceedings (where you would be permitted to ask the defendant questions about their assets, e.g., Where do you bank? Where do you work? What`s your social security number? What`s your date of birth?, etc.) You can then use this information to file an execution; 3)You can have an Abstract of Judgment issued and record it at the Washoe County Recorder`s office. The Abstract of Judgment will enable you to collect on the judgment when the defendant sells a piece of real estate since any liens must be satisfied before the defendant can sell the property. (See Small Claims Costs)."
"Reno Justice Court";"Small Claims";"Do I get a copy of the judgment after court?  ";"You do not AUTOMATICALLY get a copy of the judgment after court. You must request it and one will be sent to you."
"Reno Justice Court";"Small Claims";"What do I do if I sued for the wrong amount or sued the wrong person?  ";"In that case, you must amend the Small Claim. You should make sure that your court date is at least 10 days away. If not, you should request a continuance.  If you are either amending a name or amount, you need to explain this to the clerk and provide the clerk with the case number and court date. The clerk will prepare an amended complaint for you to sign and serve with the new information."
"Reno Justice Court";"Small Claims";"What do I do if I could not have the defendant served?  ";"You need to bring all your pink copies of the Small Claim Complaint to Reno Justice Court and ask that the hearing be RESET. The clerk will put the new court date on your copies and the original and hopefully you can get it served by that date. A new home or work address would be helpful in increasing the possibility of service."
"Reno Justice Court";"Small Claims";"I was mailed a continuance letter, but it went to my old address and I missed my court date. What do I do now?  

";"If you move, whether you are the plaintiff or the defendant, you must keep the court informed of your new address and phone number and the clerk will include that information on your claim.   If you are the plaintiff and you missed your court date, you may file a Motion to Set Aside Dismissal.  If you are the defendant you may file a Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment."
"Reno Justice Court";"Small Claims";"I can`t come to the Small Claims hearing on the date set. How do I postpone it?  ";"As soon as possible, you must either mail or fax a letter to the judge assigned to your case requesting a continuance.  If you are requesting a continuance on the day of court, the judge may not be able to accommodate you."
"Reno Justice Court";"Small Claims";"Can I have a Small Claim served by Certified Mail if I only have a Post Office Box?  ";"Yes. If you have a Post Office Box or a regular street address, you can have it served by Certified Mail. The court mails the Small Claim and the fee is $8.00 per defendant."
"Reno Justice Court";"Small Claims";"Can I file a Small Claim for damages, pain and suffering or punitive damages?   ";"The judges do not award punitive damages except on rare occasions. If you feel punitive damages are warranted, sue for the amount you want and itemize what you are suing for and the judge may award them to you.  The judge may also subtract them from the principal amount of the judgment."
"Reno Justice Court";"Small Claims";"If my server cannot serve the defendant, how do I find out his address?  ";"The Court does not have the means to find this information for you. You can try the Post Office or you can hire an investigator to find this information for you. You can also have the defendant served at work."
"Reno Justice Court";"Small Claims";"How long do I have to file a Small Claim after the incident occurred?  ";"You have a minimum of 2 years and a maximum of 6 years to file it depending upon what type of claim you have.  To determine what type of claim you have, you must either seek legal advice or research it through the Nevada Revised Statutes. The Nevada Revised Statutes are available to the public at the Washoe County Law Library or <a href=\"http://www.leg.state.nv.us\" target=_blank>www.leg.state.nv.us</a>."
"Reno Justice Court";"Small Claims";"Can an attorney represent me in Small Claims Court?

"Senior Services";"Senior Law Project";"I`d like to make a Living Will.";"This document is also called an Advance Directive. An advance directive is a written statement, which you complete in advance of a serious illness, about how you want medical decisions made. The two most common forms of advance directives are: 
A Â“Living Will,Â” or Â“Declaration;Â” and 
A Â“Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care.Â” 
An advance directive allows you to state your choices for health care or to name someone to make those choices for you, if you become unable to make decisions about your medical treatment. In short, an advance directive can enable you to make decisions about your future medical treatment. You can say Â“yesÂ” to treatment you want, or say Â“noÂ” to treatment you don`t want.

"Social Services";"Adoption";"What are the fees associated with adoption?";"Fees are charged for non-special needs adoption based on a sliding scale approved through the Board of County Commissioners.  Fees for non-special needs adoption are split into two payments, one given pre-placement for completion of the home study, and the second for post placement supervision.  

Fees associated with special needs adoption are typically waived with the exception of attorneyÂ’s fees, which are reimbursed up to $250.00.  Details on fees can be found within the Adoption Fees section of the website.
"
"Social Services";"Adoption";"Are adoptive parents eligible for subsidy?";"Subsidies are available for children with special needs; eligibility is determined pursuant to the State of Nevada definition of a special needs child.  Once eligible, the type and amount of a subsidy are determined in a review of needed resources in conjunction with the needs of the child.  Subsidies are provided in the form of medical and/or financial assistance.  For further information please see the Post Adoption Assistance section of the website."
"Social Services";"Adoption";"Will we have a choice as to the child we adopt?";"The preferred age, ethnic background, sex of child and number of children is specified by you in your application to an agency and is discussed during the course of the home study process. Your preference is respected by the agency. Similar interests, racial background and intellect may be considered by your agency worker when placing a child with you. For example, a child with disabilities is not placed with a family who is not receptive to a child with disabilities. However, remember the more limiting you are in your choices, the longer it may take to identify a child for placement."
"Social Services";"Adoption";"Are we told everything about the child? (i.e. medical history, family situation, education, religion, employment, background of parents, reason for relinquishments, etc.)";"In an agency adoption, adopting parents are told all known information about the child and his or her background. In cases of abandonment, little is known; otherwise the child`s history has been recorded and is shared with the adopting parents. Identifying information provided will depend on the type of adoption chosen by the birth and adoptive parents. Families adopting privately/independently have direct contact with the birth parent(s), and may have obtained this information of their own. WCDSS adoption staff collects and records the information as a part of the adoption service, this information is provided to the adopting parents."
"Social Services";"Adoption";"Will birth parents know who we are?";"Only if you want the birth parents to know who you are. If you choose to participate in an open, semi-open, or private/independent adoption, they will know more about you."
"Social Services";"Adoption";"If we move out of town or out of state before the adoption is final, do we have to give up the child or can another agency take over the proceedings?";"The agency will usually ask for courtesy supervision by a licensed adoption agency in your new location.

"Social Services";"Adoption";"Can the birth parents regain custody of the child prior to the final adoption proceedings?";"Relinquishments and consents to adopt signed and executed according to Nevada Statutes are irrevocable.

"Social Services";"Adoption";"What about all the rumors about having to meet difficult financial, emotional, and physical requirements before being approved by an agency to adopt a child?";"Interviews between agency and prospective adoptive parents are necessary. It is the law in Nevada that in order to adopt a non-related child, a family must be approved by a licensed child placement agency. The home study is not meant to create anxiety, but to place children with the best parents for them. Each agency has its own procedure. If you can meet agency requirements and can provide love, security, guidance, commitment and a stable environment for a future son or daughter, you can become an adoptive parent."
"Social Services";"Adoption";"Is it difficult to adopt a Native American child?";"If you are not Native American, the requirements of the Indian Child Welfare Act must be followed.

"Social Services";"Child Protective Services";"What is Child Protective Services?";"Washoe County Department of Social Services (also called Child Protective Services, CPS or Social Services) is required by Nevada law to investigate reports of suspected child abuse and neglect. The focus of CPS is to protect children from harm and to make sure that children live in safe environments. The actions taken by Social Services are determined by the family`s situation. Washoe County Department of Social Services must make efforts to help families overcome problems, but sometimes children must be removed from their homes to ensure their safety. 
	
Any legal action taken by Social Services takes place in Family Court as a civil matter, not a criminal matter. The police may investigate child abuse and neglect but it is a separate process from a CPS investigation. The police and the criminal division of the District Attorney`s Office make the decision to arrest or file criminal charges, not Social Services.
"
"Social Services";"Child Protective Services";"How did CPS hear about me?";"Any person who believes a child is being abused or neglected may make a report to CPS or the police. Additionally, Nevada law requires certain people to make reports of suspected child abuse or neglect. These mandated reporters include doctors, dentists, nurses, hospital personnel, daycare providers, clergy, social workers, teachers and counselors. Mandated reporters can be charged with a misdemeanor if they fail to report suspected child abuse or neglect.
	
Nevada law does not allow Social Services to disclose the name of the reporting person.
"
"Social Services";"Child Protective Services";"What is child abuse and neglect?";"Nevada law defines several types of child abuse and neglect: 
	
Physical Injury (NRS 432B.090):  A non-accidental injury to a child including bruises, cuts, bite marks, burns and broken bones.
	
Mental Injury (NRS 432B.070):  An injury to a child`s intellectual, psychological or emotional condition causing impairment of a child`s normal range of performance or behavior. 
	
Sexual Abuse or Exploitation (NRS 432B.100 & 432B.110):  Any sexual activity with a child, including fondling and lewdness, or encouraging or allowing a child to view pornographic material or engage in prostitution or pornography.
	
Negligent Treatment or Maltreatment (NRS 432B.140):  Failure to provide a child with proper care, control or supervision, food, education, shelter or medical care. This includes leaving a young child alone or with someone who cannot or does not properly care for a child.

A parent or guardian is responsible for the abuse or neglect of a child if he or she causes or allows the abuse or neglect. "
"Social Services";"Child Protective Services";"Is discipline considered abuse?";"Reasonable discipline is not considered abuse or neglect. In determining what is reasonable, the following factors must be considered:

- The child`s age;
- The child`s physical or psychological conditions or disabilities;
- The frequency and duration of the discipline;
- The location of the physical discipline (buttocks vs. face); and
- The use of an instrument (belt, cord, whip etc.).

Nevada law allows a parent or guardian to \"spank\" a child as a form of discipline, but an injury cannot be left on a child."
"Social Services";"Child Protective Services";"What happens during a CPS investigation?";"CPS must investigate reports of alleged child abuse or neglect. The type of allegation and the child`s age are factors that determine how quickly an investigation is started.  
	
The social worker gathers information regarding the alleged abuse or neglect by interviewing the child, the child`s caretaker, the parent(s) or guardian(s) and others who may have information about the family`s situation. The social worker may also gather information from other CPS agencies, law enforcement, medical and school personnel. Based upon the facts of the case, a decision is made about the child`s safety and the level of intervention required. 

Nevada law allows a CPS social worker to interview a child about allegations of abuse or neglect without the permission and outside the presence of the parent or guardian.
"
"Social Services";"Child Protective Services";"What are the possible outcomes of a CPS investigation?";"After the investigation is complete, CPS must determine if abuse or neglect occurred and how to address the problem. Here are the possibilities:

- CPS may decide that abuse or neglect has not occurred (\"unsubstantiated\"). The case may be closed without further intervention.

- CPS may decide that abuse or neglect has not occurred (\"unsubstantiated\"), but the family is in need of services. With parent approval, the case is kept open for voluntary services.

- CPS may decide that abuse or neglect occurred (substantiation). Several things can happen depending on the child`s safety: 

  -  If the child can remain safely in the home without court involvement, the parent(s) or guardian(s) will be asked to participate in a case plan and a safety plan. 

  -  If the child`s safety requires court involvement, CPS will place your child into protective custody. The parent(s) or guardian(s) will be required to participate in a case plan.
"
"Social Services";"Child Protective Services";"What happens if my child is placed into protective custody?";"A CPS social worker or police officer can place a child into protective custody if he or she believes immediate action is needed to protect a child from abuse or neglect. You will receive written notice listing the date and time for the Protective Custody Hearing. Nevada law requires a hearing be held within 72 hours (excluding weekends and holidays) after a child has been placed into protective custody.
	
A child taken into protective custody must be placed into an emergency shelter, a licensed foster home or with a suitable relative. In determining a relative`s suitability, Social Services considers the condition of the relative`s home, criminal background, history of abuse or neglect, substance abuse history, ability and willingness to protect the child from the parent (or guardian) and cooperation with the case plan developed by the social worker and the family.

Relatives must follow the guidelines provided by the social worker. If not, your child may be removed from the relative`s home and placed into a licensed foster home or facility. 
	
It is important for you to provide information about your relatives early in your case!
"
"Social Services";"Child Protective Services";"Can I see my child if he or she is in protective custody?";"Yes! You and your social worker should develop a visitation plan, which outlines the days, times and locations for visitation. Depending on the circumstances of your case, visits may be supervised. Keep in mind that visitation is a time to visit with your child, not to discuss issues in your case with your child or social worker.

Frequent visits are important to you and your child. Your child needs you involved in his or her life!"
"Social Services";"Child Protective Services";"When & where can I get a lawyer if my child is taken into protective custody?";"Although the court will not provide a public defender for the Protective Custody Hearing, you have the right to hire an attorney. You may ask the judge for a continuance of the Protective Custody Hearing so you can hire a lawyer. You can find a lawyer in the telephone book or by calling the lawyer referral service of the State Bar of Nevada at 1-800-789-5747.

If your case is not resolved at the Protective Custody Hearing you may apply for a public defender. Following the Protective Custody Hearing, you will be served with a legal document called a Petition for Hearing and an Application for Appointment of Public Defender. You must complete the application and return it to the court immediately.

If you qualify for a public defender, the court will send you an Order Appointing Public Defender. The Public Defender`s office will contact you by mail to arrange a time to meet with you. If you do not qualify for public defender services and want an attorney to represent you at future hearings, you must hire one. 

It is important that you tell your social worker and attorney of address and telephone number changes.
"
"Social Services";"Child Protective Services";"What is a Protective Custody Hearing?";"During the Protective Custody Hearing the social worker explains to the judge why your child was placed into protective custody. You are then given a chance to talk to the judge. Based on the facts, the judge decides if your child will remain in protective custody or be released to you.

If the judge decides that your child should remain in protective custody, the judge will issue a Protective Custody Order. Protective Custody Orders only last for ten (10) days. If the problems are fixed during these ten (10) days, Social Services may return your child to your custody. If it is necessary to keep custody of your child for more than ten (10) days, then Social Services must file a legal document called a Petition for Hearing in Family Court. 

During this time, Social Services will continue to work with you to solve the problems that caused the abuse or neglect. Your child will live with a foster family or with a suitable relative, or in some cases with you. You must get permission from Social Services before you travel out of the area or allow new people to move into your home if your child is living with you while Social Services has custody of your child.

Washoe County Department of Social Services has the responsibility to make sure that your child is safe and receives proper care. Your involvement in your child`s medical, dental and educational care is important. Talk to your social worker about any concerns you have regarding your child`s care.
"
"Social Services";"Child Protective Services";"What is an Adjudicatory Hearing?";"If Social Services believes your child is in need of protection and that court involvement is necessary, Social Services will file a legal document called a Petition for Hearing. The Washoe County Sheriff`s Office will serve you with the Petition for Hearing and an Order Upon Petition. The Order Upon Petition provides the date and time for the next hearing. This hearing is called the Adjudicatory Hearing. It is important for you to attend this hearing.
	
The Petition for Hearing lists the reasons why Social Services thinks your child is in need of protection. At the Adjudicatory Hearing you will be asked to do one of the following: 
	
(1) Admit that all or some of the allegations are true; or
(2) Choose not to comment; or 
(3) Deny the allegations and ask for an Evidentiary Hearing (a trial).
	
If you admit that the allegations are true or choose not to comment, the judge will decide if your child has been abused or neglected. 
	
If you deny the allegations in the Petition for Hearing and request an Evidentiary Hearing (trial), a new court date is set.
"
"Social Services";"Child Protective Services";"What is an Evidentiary Hearing?";"Prior to the Evidentiary Hearing, the court will hold a Settlement Conference. The goal of a Settlement Conference is to solve disagreements without going to trial. If an agreement cannot be reached at the Settlement Conference, the case will proceed to the Evidentiary Hearing. 
	
During the Evidentiary Hearing, Social Services will present evidence and witnesses in support of the allegations in the Petition for Hearing. You have the right to question the witnesses and the evidence. You may also present your own evidence and witnesses. 
	
Social Services must prove the allegations by a \"preponderance of evidence\". This means that it is more likely that the allegations are true than not true. 
	
At the end of the hearing, the judge decides whether abuse or neglect has occurred and if your child is in need of protection. The judge then proceeds to the dispositional portion of the hearing.
"
"Social Services";"Child Protective Services";"What is a Dispositional Hearing?";"This hearing is usually held two to three weeks after the Adjudicatory Hearing. The social worker writes a court report detailing the condition of your home, your child`s progress in school, the mental, physical and social background of your family and the progress made on the case plan (See How do I get my child back?). The report also makes recommendations for services and activities to ensure your child`s safety. 
	
You will be provided a copy of the court report prior to the hearing. Talk to your social worker about any concerns you have about the report. You may also talk to the judge about your concerns during the hearing.  
	
During the hearing the judge will give you a chance to discuss any issues you believe are important. At the end of the hearing the judge decides where your child will live and what you and Social Services must do to reach the case plan goal.
	
If your child is placed in emergency shelter or foster care, you will be ordered to pay child support. Talk to your attorney or the judge if you feel that repaying those costs will interfere with your ability to provide an adequate and safe home for your child.
"
"Social Services";"Child Protective Services";"What is a Multidisciplinary Team Meeting (MDT)?";"About three months after the Protective Custody Hearing, a MDT is held between you, your social worker, a deputy district attorney, your attorney, your child (if age appropriate) and the foster family or relative placement to your child. Ask your social worker to invite others you think is important to your family`s success. 
	
The MDT is a chance to review your case plan and the progress made on the case plan. It is also a time to let everyone know what is helpful to your family`s success. It is important for you to attend this meeting because it replaces a formal court hearing. 
"
"Social Services";"Child Protective Services";"What is a Review Hearing?";"The court reviews the progress of your case six months after your child is removed from your home. Your social worker sends an updated report to the judge describing the progress made on your case plan. You will receive a copy of the report prior to the hearing. Again, discuss any concerns about the report with the social worker. You may also raise your concerns with the judge during the hearing.
	
At the end of the hearing the judge will decide if it is safe to return your child to your home. If the judge does not feel it is safe to return your child home, you and Social Services will be ordered to keep working on your case plan.
"
"Social Services";"Child Protective Services";"What is a Permanency Hearing?";"Federal and state laws require Social Services to find a safe, appropriate and permanent home for any child placed into foster care. A Permanency Hearing must be held within 12 months after a child is placed into protective custody. At this hearing, the court orders a permanent plan for your child. The permanent plan depends on the facts of each case. A permanent plan is one of the following:
	
- Reunification with the parent or guardian;
- Adoption;
- Permanent guardianship; or
- Permanent custody of the child with a fit and willing relative.

Sometimes the judge will order a concurrent plan. Concurrent means that two permanent plans are worked on at the same time. 

You must show significant progress on your case plan prior to the permanency hearing or the judge may choose a different permanent plan for your child such as guardianship or adoption.
"
"Social Services";"Child Protective Services";"How do I get my child back from protective custody?";"Unless the court orders differently, the goal of Social Services is to reunify you and your child. Prior to the Adjudicatory Hearing, you will be assigned a permanency social worker. This new social worker and the assessment social worker will develop a case plan with you. The case plan identifies what you and Social Services must do to provide a safe environment for your child. It is important for you to take an active role in creating your case plan. It is important for you to maintain contact with your social worker because your permanency social worker will assist you in achieving your case plan goals.  
	
A case plan is a \"working document\" that changes during your involvement with Social Services and the court. No changes should occur in your case plan without your knowledge. The court reviews all case plans. You should be aware that the court might order you to do additional things that are not listed in the case plan. 
	
Your participation in the services identified by safety plans, case plans and court orders is how you show that it is safe and appropriate to have your child returned to your care. In order to reunify with your child, you must make significant progress on the case plan prior to the permanency hearing.
"
"Social Services";"Child Protective Services";"How much time do I have to get my child back from protective custody?";"Federal and state laws require Social Services to find a safe, appropriate and permanent home for a child who is in foster care. The court decides if a child will be returned to the parent or placed for adoption, permanent guardianship or permanent custody with a relative within 12 months after the child is placed into protective custody.

There is a presumption that parental rights should be terminated and the child placed for adoption if the child that has been in foster care for 14 out of the last 20 months.

Because of time limits, it is very important for you to:

- Maintain contact with your social worker;
- Develop a case plan;
- Participate in services; and
- Show the court that you have made substantial progress in your case plan to ensure that it is safe and appropriate to return your child home.
"
"Social Services";"Child Protective Services";"Are you of Native American descent?";"Native American families have additional protections under federal and state law. The federal law is called the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA). If you or your child is affiliated with any federally recognized Indian tribe, or if your relatives are Native American, inform your social worker immediately!"
"Social Services";"Child Protective Services";"What can I do if I disagree with my social worker?";"	Open discussions with your social worker usually solve disagreements. If not, you may contact your social worker`s supervisor. You may also raise concerns with your lawyer and the judge. However, it is best if you attempt to fix the problem with your social worker so you don`t have to wait for a court hearing."
"Social Services";"Child Protective Services";"What is a Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA)?";"The court may appoint a CASA to your child. CASAs are volunteers from the community. The CASA`s role is to act as an advocate for your child`s best interests and report to the court your child`s progress while in custody of Washoe County Department of Social Services."
"Social Services";"Foster Care";"What are the classes like, that prepares people to care for foster children?";"There are 27 total hours of pre-service training.  Topics include Washoe County policy, Medicaid policy, abuse and neglect issues, child sexual abuse, how abuse and neglect effect children`s development, attachment, separation and grief issues for children, discipline, cultural issues, primary families, effects of care giving on the caregiver and adoption issues.  This informative training, which is provided in English and Spanish gives foster parents essential tools to care for children in their care.  CPR and First Aid training is strongly recommended."
"Social Services";"Foster Care";"What is the need for foster parents?";"Currently there are more than 1000 diverse children in Washoe County and the state of Nevada`s custody.  In the Reno area alone, there are approximately 900 children in foster care and less than 400 foster families."
"Social Services";"Foster Care";"Who are the children that need foster care?";"Children in foster care have the same interests, abilities, dreams and needs as all children.  They come from all ethnic and religious backgrounds.  These children have been removed from their homes because of abuse, neglect or life threatening conditions.  These children need safety, security, attention and support.  They need an understanding and loving family. Often they have serious emotional and behavioral problems that require supervision, guidance, and psychological counseling."
"Social Services";"Foster Care";"What are the ages of children in foster care?";"Our agency provides foster care placements for children age 0 to 18 years.  We would like flexible families to consider accepting children of all ages. "
"Social Services";"Foster Care";"How long does a child usually stay in foster care?";"The average time a child stays in foster care is 9-12 months.  A child may be in your home for a few weeks, months or even years.  The length of stay depends on the needs of the child and his/her parent`s participation in their service program.  The child`s caseworker works with foster parents regarding placement goals and needs of the child. "
"Social Services";"Foster Care";"Do I get to choose the children who come into my foster home?";"Foster parents can select the age range and gender of the children that come into their home.  They can help decide if a child is appropriate for their situation.  Every attempt is made to initially match a child to a family who is able to meet the child`s individual needs.  This prevents the child from being moved from home to home.  Children can be matched with the best foster family when there are a large number of foster families to choose from, which often means that families may wait for a placement. "
"Social Services";"Foster Care";"What kind of financial/medical help is available if I foster children? ";"Foster parents are reimbursed by the Department for caring for a child.  The rate of basic care depends upon the age of the child.  The daily rate of care is $40.00 for 0-18 years old, for the 1st 90 days and $30.00 per day for each day after the initial 90 days of stay.  Foster parents who are caring for children with significant behavioral or medical problems may be reimbursed at a higher rate.  Medicaid covers childrenÂ’s medical, dental, and psychological needs. "
"Social Services";"Foster Care";"What kind of help can I receive in caring for a foster child?";"Evaluations and services for the child placed into your home are routinely coordinated by the child`s caseworker.  Caseworkers are available to answer questions you might have about the child(ren) placed into your home.  Clinical staff is available to help you with any specific behavior problem or parenting questions you may have.  Foster Liaisons are assigned to each foster family and can answer any questions you may have regarding agency policy and procedure.  They can also assist in understanding the agency or the child welfare process in securing any additional services that might be appropriate."
"Social Services";"Foster Care";"Can we foster if we both work full time?";"Yes. School aged children and teenagers may be placed in homes where both parents work, depending upon the needs of the child.  Washoe County does not reimburse foster parents for day care.  Infants and preschoolers are generally placed in foster homes where one parent does not work outside the home."
"Social Services";"Foster Care";"How many children can be in a foster home?";"There is no limit to the number a family may have prior to becoming a foster parent.  However; there can be no more than four children in foster care in the home.  There can be no more than two infants under the age of two in a foster family, including the parent`s own children. "
"Social Services";"Foster Care";"What are the required conditions of my home to become a foster home?";"Your home should be clean, adequately furnished, in good repair, free from health and fire hazards and comply with local fire ordinances.  A foster home must be equipped with a smoke detector on each level, a fire extinguisher, a working telephone and a first aid kit. All firearms, ammunition, medication, and hazardous chemicals (cleaning supplies) must be kept locked in storage.  Children in foster care may share a bedroom with another child of the same sex and compatible age; however, a separate bed must be provided for each child.  An individual`s room must have 80 square feet (8` x 10`).  If children share a bedroom, they must each have 60 square feet (120 sq. ft. for two children or 10` x 12`).  Licensing will send you a complete list of requirements after your initial application has been submitted."
"Social Services";"Foster Care";"Can foster parents adopt children?";"Yes.  However, the primary goal of WCDSS is to protect children and strengthen families. Staff work with families to resolve concerns that led to the initial removal of the child from their primary home.  Parents whose children are in foster care have 12 to 18 months from the time of their child`s removal to remedy their problems.  During this time, the intent of WCDSS is to return children to the care of their biological parents.  Foster parents play a key role in supporting and mentoring the birth family.  If the biological parents do not improve the situation in the home, the Department may seek to terminate the parent`s rights, thus freeing the child for adoption. 

Families interested in adopting must assume the risk that the child will return to the care of the biological parents.  Foster families need to be supportive of agency efforts to return children to their natural families.  If the child you are fostering becomes available for adoption, you may ask to be considered with other adoptive parents.  Foster/adoptive parents may adopt a child and still continue to foster, if they choose.  There is no guarantee that foster parents will be able to adopt the children placed in their home.

"Treasurer`s Office";"!GENERAL QUESTIONS ABOUT CERTIFICATE SALES";"What is a tax lien certificate?";"A tax lien certificate is a Certificate of Sale note issued on a property that is sold for nonpayment of a special assessment."
"Treasurer`s Office";"!GENERAL QUESTIONS ABOUT CERTIFICATE SALES";"Where are the sales held?";"1001 East Ninth Street, Reno, Nevada.  Specific room is announced when sale is scheduled."
"Treasurer`s Office";"!GENERAL QUESTIONS ABOUT CERTIFICATE SALES";"How do I find out what parcels are subject to a certificate sale?";"The available parcels will be posted on the Special Assessment website: www.amgnv.com, at the beginning of the sale month.  They will also be published in the Reno Gazette Journal, one time each week, for the three consecutive weeks prior to the sale date.  It should be noted that property owners, or their mortgage company, may bring the assessment current up to the day of the sale.  On the sale date, they may pay the assessment off before the time of the sale."
"Treasurer`s Office";"!INCLINE VILLAGE/CRYSTAL BAY REFUNDS";"01. What is the process for generating the refunds?";"Adjustments will be made to the 2006/07 assessed values, as ordered, and refunds will be determined based on those changes.  Each parcel requires individual manual calculations, with a check list of over 25 items to ensure process integrity and quality control.  On average, each parcel's calculation takes approximately 1.5 hours to process."
"Treasurer`s Office";"!INCLINE VILLAGE/CRYSTAL BAY REFUNDS";"02. Did my parcel receive an adjusted 2006/07 assessed value?";"For a list of parcels that have received adjusted 2006/07 values, <a href=\"/repository/files/17/Incline Village - Crystal Bay Parcel List.xls\"> click here.</a>  
Assessed value information can be found on the <a href=\"/assessor/cama/search.php\">Assessor's webpage.</a>"
"Treasurer`s Office";"!INCLINE VILLAGE/CRYSTAL BAY REFUNDS";"03.  I owned the property in 2006.  Will I get a refund or does it go to the current owner?";"Refunds will be made to the party who made the tax payment for any year or portion of a year where a refund is due."
"Treasurer`s Office";"!INCLINE VILLAGE/CRYSTAL BAY REFUNDS";"04.  When can I expect to get my refund?";"Adjustments will be worked in groups of parcels, beginning with any large refunds that can be identified, those who paid under protest, and after that in parcel number order.  Any resulting refunds will be mailed out as each group is completed.  Large refunds that can be identified are being targeted first in order to reduce the accruing interest costs."
"Treasurer`s Office";"!INCLINE VILLAGE/CRYSTAL BAY REFUNDS";"05.  How long will it take?";"We estimate that the time required to adjust and manually calculate the refund for an average parcel is 1.5 hours involving 25 different steps.  With approximately 8,700 parcels, this is the equivalent of one person doing nothing else for over 5 years.  However, we have obtained additional staff resources, and continue to evaluate ways to streamline the process in order to minimize the completion time as much as possible."
"Treasurer`s Office";"!INCLINE VILLAGE/CRYSTAL BAY REFUNDS";"06.  Why is it taking so long to get my refund?";"Each parcel must be handled individually and researched thoroughly to ensure that the correct amount is refunded to the appropriate taxpayer.  Other factors such as ownership changes and parcel splits require additional research which slows down the process further.  It is our goal to process the refunds as quickly as possible, in order to minimize the wait time, and the interest cost.  We are working to balance the need for accuracy with the need for efficiency, all the while maintaining the flow of normal day to day County business."
"Treasurer`s Office";"!INCLINE VILLAGE/CRYSTAL BAY REFUNDS";"07.  I'm expecting a refund.  Should I keep paying my taxes?";"The roll-forward effect of the 2006/07 value change will impact each parcel differently, depending on variables unique to that parcel, such as the amount the value is reduced from the original 2006/07 value, and the amount of tax that was originally abated in 2006/07 and in subsequent years.  Because there is no way to know how the adjustment will impact the amount due on a particular current year tax bill until the calculation is done for that parcel, the Treasurer strongly encourages Incline Village/Crystal Bay residents to continue to pay their taxes in a timely manner.  Delinquencies will accrue penalty and interest pursuant to NRS 361.483."
"Treasurer`s Office";"!INCLINE VILLAGE/CRYSTAL BAY REFUNDS";"08.  My mortgage company paid my taxes; will the refund go to them?";"In general, when a payment was made by a mortgage company for a previous tax year, any refund will be made to the party(ies) that the payment was made on behalf of."

"Treasurer`s Office";"!INCLINE VILLAGE/CRYSTAL BAY REFUNDS";"10.  Will I be paid interest on my refund?";"Interest will be paid on refunds as required by Nevada Revised Statute and the district court's order."
"Treasurer`s Office";"!INCLINE VILLAGE/CRYSTAL BAY REFUNDS";"11. Why do I have to complete a W-9?";"Per IRS requirements, a form 1099 must be issued for any interest paid of $600.00 or more in a year.  We are not able to pay the interest until we have a completed and verified W-9 form that would allow us to comply with that requirement.  We recommend that any taxpayer with federal tax questions should contact their tax advisor."
"Treasurer`s Office";"!INCLINE VILLAGE/CRYSTAL BAY REFUNDS";"12. Can I submit a W-9 ahead of time?";"If you have owned property in the Incline Village/Crystal Bay area anytime since 2006 and believe that you may be entitled to a refund, you may submit a W-9 form to us which will expedite the interest portion of any refund.  For those who have not submitted in advance, the tax portion of the refund will be sent, along with a W-9 form that will need to be returned in order to receive the interest portion.

"Treasurer`s Office";"!INCLINE VILLAGE/CRYSTAL BAY REFUNDS";"13. Can my refund be applied to the current taxes owing?";"The Supreme Court's ruling confirms the District Court's decision ordering the Treasurer to make refunds, not provide credits toward current or future tax obligation, but a refund may be applied to current taxes owing upon written request of the person entitled to the refund.  Because we cannot guarantee when the process will be completed for a specific parcel, even after submitting such a request, we urge you to make timely payments on your taxes until you are notified that your refund has been determined.

"Treasurer`s Office";"!INCLINE VILLAGE/CRYSTAL BAY REFUNDS";"16.  Will I receive an adjusted bill for the current year?  Do I have to pay the current tax bill since
       it does not reflect the Supreme Court decision?";"You may receive an adjusted bill.  However, since the roll forward affect of the 2006/07 value change will
impact each parcel differently (depending on variables unique to that parcel), there is no way to know 
whether it will impact the amount due on a particular current year tax bill until the calculation is done for
that parcel.  Thus, the Treasurer is urging Incline Village/Crystal Bay residents to continue to pay their 
full tax payment in a timely manner.  Delinquencies will accrue penalty and interest pursuant to NRS 361.483."
"Treasurer`s Office";"!INCLINE VILLAGE/CRYSTAL BAY REFUNDS";"17. Why has this process taken so long to be resolved?";"The July 7 decision is related to several other cases that have been heard before both the county and state boards of equalization, as well as in various courts over the past several years.  The Supreme Court's ruling in this case, for example, took two years to be decided.  In addition, the County Assessor waited several years for the Nevada Tax Commission to promulgate approved assessment methods affecting the appraisals in Incline Village and Crystal Bay.  Throughout the process, both sides have won and lost decisions, and as is common with litigation, there have been various appeals of those decisions by both sides.  Throughout, Washoe County has consistently strived to protect the interests of all taxpayers in the County, and to insure that important legal questions were fully resolved to prevent future conflicts of this nature."
"Treasurer`s Office";"!INCLINE VILLAGE/CRYSTAL BAY REFUNDS";"18. Why didn't the County prepare and set any money aside for this?";"There have been multiple related court cases on this issue, some won by the County.  For the past five years, Washoe County has cut spending by $154 million and reduced staff by 20% in response to dwindling revenues.  Saving money required to fund this possible liability would have meant cutting employee jobs and cutting services to the public even more.  We never want to adversly impact employees and our citizens without an unavoidable reason."
"Treasurer`s Office";"!INCLINE VILLAGE/CRYSTAL BAY REFUNDS";"19. Will I need to amend my federal and/or state tax return for previous years?";"While we can't provide you with tax advice, if you itemized your tax returns for previous years claiming what you paid for property taxes, it would be advisable for you to consult your tax professional."
"Treasurer`s Office";"!INCLINE VILLAGE/CRYSTAL BAY REFUNDS";"20. How can I donate my refund back to the County?";"Donations to the County are authorized and managed pursuant to Washoe County Code 15.140-15.160, and must be accepted by the Washoe Board of County Commissioners.  If you wish to donate all or any portion of your refund to the County, please submit your donation, along with a letter stating your wishes.  Be sure to include your name and address, including telephone and/or email, and your parcel number.

The property owner can pay the taxes up to the date of the sale, however once it is legally advertised, a temporary restraining order is required in order to prevent the sale and enable payment of the taxes.  Therefore, the properties listed may not all go to auction.  The legal advertisement of the tax sale is published once a week for four (4) consecutive weeks in the local newspaper, the Reno Gazette Journal."
"Treasurer`s Office";"Real Property Tax Sales";"How do I get information on the properties to be auctioned?";"The County Assessor's Office will have maps on all properties to be sold.  You may search the County Recorder's records for any recorded documentation you deem relevant.

You may also want to contact the various county or city zoning/planning departments.  "

The County makes no representation or claims as to fitness for purpose, ingress/egress, conditions, covenants or restrictions.  The County's sole interest is the recovery of all delinquent taxes, penalties, interest and costs."

You can also look up your voter registration status on this web site.  The information found on the web site will be the most current information available.  "
"Voters, Registrar of";;"What if I am in the Military or Live Overseas?";"In these instances, it is probably most efficient to use the Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) which is a combination registration form and absentee ballot request.

While your FPCA registration form is valid until cancelled, the absent ballot request is good for only the calendar year in which it is submitted and must be renewed before each year`s elections.

By choosing to be a \"Nonpartisan\" or affiliated with one of the minor political parties, a registrant is restricted to voting only for candidates for nonpartisan offices and the questions that appear on their Primary Election Ballot.

Remember, in a General Election, all voters are eligible to vote on all candidates, races and questions that appear on their ballot, regardless of their or a candidate`s party affiliation. "
"Voters, Registrar of";;"What are Major and Minor Political Parties?";"In Nevada, only the Democrat Party and Republican Party are designated as MAJOR Political Parties.  The members of these parties choose their candidates to run for office (and face all other candidates) through the conduct of a Primary Election.

The Green Party, Independent American Party, Libertarian Party, Natural Law Party and Reform Party are MINOR Political Parties.  While members of these Minor Political Parties are still eligible to vote for nonpartisan offices on their ballots in a Primary Election, they nominate their candidates for office by conducting statewide conventions for their party members only."

I do not believe TMWA has developed a hook up fee for the Joint Service Area.  It would be best if you contact TMWA for the cost information.
